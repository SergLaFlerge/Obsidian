# The scene

Current offer: $1650/month. Split evenly that is $825/month/person. 2 bed 2 baths, with a den.

First question: Location? If it's too far away from work/school or if the buses are not convenient then I simply can't live there.

Secondly: Move-in date? It it's during the school year I may have to wait till reading week to move in from physical lack of time. Maybe book a weekend off from work? Definitely will have to save for the rest of the summer.

Third and last big question: What is included in the rent? Pretty self-explanatory, this one.

Averaged out from last semester, I work around 12.213 hrs/week, totaling roughly $195/week, or $780/month. This is without taking into account reading weeks or vacations, where I work up to twice as much. During reading weeks, and basically full-time otherwise. School-months would be the only troublesome ones.

Obviously $780 is less than $825, so at least during school I would have to pay less than half of rent. But I also have my own expenses, so what are they?

*Not technically an expense, but it is money this is being moved around*. This also does **not** include food, which is another level of expense.

I need to eat every day, and often it'll be outside of home assuming I forego subway and replace it with A&W every day, I would spend a total of $388.92 every four weeks. Therefore, assuming a budget of $780/month, with all my expenses, the total amount of rent I could pay is...

About $240. That leaves you with $1410 to pay, without taking into account all other expenses that are not rent such as food, internet, et cetera. This is also and absolute maximum on my part, as that would leave me with no money every month. Is this currently viable? In the barest sense, yes, but it would be a little miserable.

# How to make this viable

These are all calculations done with my current wage of $16/hr. Should I become a guard, things change a fair amount.

## WEM lifeguard

As a guard at WEM, I would make $20.50/hr, bringing the total average per month to about $1000/month. Subtracting expenses, we are left with $460, which is nearly double what we had initially. This leaves more room for me to either pay rent or contributing to other necessary items. If I actually made lunch  even just every other day, I would save almost $200 as well, so by putting more money into good groceries and making lunch at home, we now have about $650 to play with. Some of this new money goes to groceries but now that is being taken care of without affecting our previous budget. I don't know how much we'll spend on food and such, but there are only two of us here so we can work with that. At least we both know how to cook.

## Guard somewhere else

One source says the average salary for a guard is $25/hr, while another one cites $20.49/hr. Taking an average of the averages we get about $22.75/hr, or $1175/month. This only holds true assuming I work about the same I work at the water park. Likely I would have to either quit the park entirely, or work one day a week in each facility. The other problem is job availability. Right now there are only two postings on Indeed.

# Other notes

These are actually all a bit of a low-ball estimate, since they assume I will only work weekends during the *entire* semester. There are two reading weeks during the school year where I would have the opportunity to work a mini full-time schedule where I could work minimum 30 hours. That is an extra $270/semester on a $16/hr salary, and an extra $350 on a $20.50 salary.

This is also only a concern *during* the school year, which is admittedly eight months of the year, but it leaves four months of full-time work where money can be saved up for anything, but mostly to help create a safety net so rent and necessities can always be paid for

That's all I got for now homie, you read this over and we can chat about it tomorrow.
