# Plan to attack next year

1. Go to office hours at least once per assignment, even if there are no questions for the specific assignment, to build a good relationship with the professors.
2. For every class in physics or math, there will be one non-physics/non-math class accompanying it, i.e. a one-to-one correspondence between science and non-science classes. Likely will be two science and two non-science classes per semester.
3. Already looking to get a tutor for next semester for English or writing studies, and for sociology or psychology.
4. Seek out one-on-one support at the academic success center as soon as the semester starts.
5. Stopping wage work for the year.
6. Will be trying to get into a music course; a subject that is also of interest and will be successful with, thanks to previous music background.
7. If possible, will be retaking two failed classes to boost GPA, as well as getting permission to retake a class in which credit was obtained, but whose grade was very low, to also increase GPA in my major for graduation. (Should the appeal be accepted and probation allows, I would then write a letter of permission to retake said class.)
8. Revisit student services to plan out the rest of my degree. See what important classes I'm missing for my major in physics and prioritizing taking these classes to finish as soon as possible.
9. I have sought out a psychological evaluation referral from a doctor at the student wellness center, and I have full economical support from my family this year.

# Draft Modifications

I got out of track in 2022 due to a personal familial situation. My grandfather had passed away on January 1st that year in Mexico, and it was a devastating blow to both my mom and I. We were unable to travel to Mexico until February, where we then spent two weeks taking care of the funeral as well as emptying his house, which was my home for five years prior to coming to Canada. After the two weeks I had to return home as it was time for midterms. I was not ready as I had to prioritize helping with the house, but nevertheless I managed to make it through the semester. The year was even more difficult for my mom, who was also injured at the time, on top of having to deal with the death of her father. That year she made less than $25 000. It was for this reason that for the last two years, I have felt the need to work more so I could cover my own expenses without asking for anything from my mom. It has never been easy for me to ask for help or recognize that I am struggling with my studies. I stay in my comfort zone of math and physics courses regardless of the load, only managing to take and pass one English course in that time.
