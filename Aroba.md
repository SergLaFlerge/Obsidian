Aroba, 

when I first met you, I didn't know where the fates would take us. The winds were uncertain, and the webs had yet to be spun. Little did I know, our lives would become intertwined in a way I can only describe as beautiful. The winds have taken us to far more colorful places than I could have imagined, and our webs now weave a tapestry that is nothing short of perfect. 

When I look at you, I see my future. I see the person I want to grow old with, I see the person I want to take care of and the person I want taking care of me. Looking back all the choices I've made in my life — good and bad — it is clear that they have all led me to you. If I had to, I would make all the same choices again and again if it meant meeting you. You are my world, my sunshine, my everything.

There are many years ahead of us. There are likely many obstacles and challenges to come. But I know we will both learn and grow from everything that comes our way. I know that, as long as I'm with you, everything will be okay. Whatever seas lie ahead of us, we shall conquer them together, because when I'm with you, everything is possible.

Here's to our Valentine's Day and our 3/2-th anniversary, and here's to many more. I can't wait to sail the sea that is life together, so let's make every moment count.

With endless love and admiration,

Yours truly,

Sergio.
