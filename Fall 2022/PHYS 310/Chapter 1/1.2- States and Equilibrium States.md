# States and Equilibrium States

The distinction between (general) *thermodynamic states* and (specific) *equilibrium states* macroscopic systems is a crucial part of thermodynamics. This important concept, for instance, needs to be mastered to understand the difference between reversible and irreversible processes later.

A macroscopic system is in a *thermodynamic state* if it can be described by volume, $V$,  and local particle number density, pressure, and temperature, $n (\mathbf{x}), \; P (\mathbf{x}), \; T (\mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{x}= (x, y, z)$ is any space point inside the system. More local thermodynamic variables may be needed for more complex systems.

We only defined $T$ for large macroscopic systems, so what does, say, *local* $T (\mathbf{x})$ mean? The concept of local temperature may seem intuitive, but we still need to properly define it. First note that the number of particles $N$ is so large that we can divide the volume $V$ into small segments such that each volume $V_{0} \ll V$ still contains a macroscopically large number of particles, and hence pressure and temperature are well-defined thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we can make the segments small enough such that the pressure and temperature are approximately constant for any individual segment. For any individual segment at position $\mathbf{x}_{0}$ inside the system, we then define

$$n (\mathbf{x}_{0})= \frac{N_{0}}{V_{0}}, \; P (\mathbf{x}_{0})= P_{0}, \; T (\mathbf{x}_{0})= T_{0},$$

Where $V_{0}, \; P_{0}, \; N_{0}, \; T_{0}$ are the volume, pressure, particle number, and temperature of that individual segment. By considering all segments at various locations, we obtain the functions $n (\mathbf{x}), \; P (\mathbf{x}), \; T (\mathbf{x})$.

The thermodynamic variables (and thus the thermodynamic state) of a system are usually controlled by *external conditions*. For instance, the volume is determined by the geometry and hones the walls of the container. The temperature can be manipulated through the temperature of the environment. The particle number may be fixed by ensuring that no particles can leave the system through leaks in the container walls.

An equilibrium state of a macroscopic system is a thermodynamic state whose local thermodynamic variables do not vary as long as the external conditions remain unchanged.

The reference to time in this definition means macroscopic scales relevant to experiment not time scales relevant to the motion of individual atoms and molecules. An equilibrium state can be prepared in practice by

1. Imposing certain external conditions,
2. Waiting.

Over a sufficiently long time, the microscopic mechanism in the system will make it *equilibrate*, i.e. reach the equilibrium state. Joshing in many cases, the external conditions do not impose any spatial variation of thermodynamic systems, and the equilibrium states are simply the *homogeneous states*, which $n (\mathbf{x}), \; P (\mathbf{x}), \; T (\mathbf{x})$ are independent of $\mathbf{x}$. Non-equilibrium states typically feature macroscopic consider currents as they appear in hydrodynamics.

The following are two examples of equilibrium and non-equilibrium states:

- In the *isothermal expansion*, a thermally isolated gas is initially confined to the left of one of two containers, with a volume $V$, with constant $n, P, T$. This is an equilibrium state.

A wall is removed, and the gas is allowed to freely expand into the second container, with the total system volume now being $2V$. The temperature does not change during this process, as the gas was thermally isolated. After a sufficiently long time the system reaches a new equilibrium with volume $2V$, density $n/2$, pressure $P/2$, and temperature $T$.

However, at any given instance of time between the two equilibriums is in a non-equilibrium state with inhomogeneous density and pressure functions $P (\mathbf{x}), \; n (\mathbf{x})$. These density or pressure gradients induce macroscopic currents (or flow) in the system.

It is possible to modify the setup such that the intermediate steps are also equilibrium states.

- Consider a homogeneous gas in a volume $V$ with spatially constant $n, P, T$. If the system is placed in earth's gravitational field, with gravitational force  $\mathbf{F}=-m_{0}g  \hat{ \mathbf{z}}$, then the homogeneous state is *not* the equilibrium state. The equilibrium state has a $z-$dependent density, pressure, and temperature (barometric height formula).
  Note: Usually, $m_{0}$ is much too small to produce a noticeable effect on the length scales of typical lab experiments. Therefore we can safely ignore gravity.

These examples may give the impression that equilibrium states cannot describe thermodynamic systems that "move", meaning their thermodynamic variables vary in time. This would be bad, since, clearly, diesel engine is only useful when it's running. Note, however, that our definition of equilibrium relies on *unchanged external conditions*. In any motor or machine, pistons and the like are moving, so that the external conditions themselves are time-varying.

We can now formulate some important definitions that specify the relation between a thermodynamic system (the "system"), assumed to be contained in a container, and the surrounding of the container (the "environment"). Consider the system as a compartment at position $\mathbf{x}_{s}$, with system thermodynamic variables 

$$T_{s}= T (\mathbf{x}_{s}), \; P_{s}= P (\mathbf{x}_{s})$$

![[System and environment.jpg]]

And the environment as a compartment at position $\mathbf{x}_{e}$, with environmental thermodynamic variables

$$T_{e}= T (\mathbf{x})_{e}, \; P_{e}= P (\mathbf{x})_{e}.$$

We say that the system is *thermally insulated* or *thermally isolated*, if the container walls do not allow the exchange of heat between the system and the environment (like a double wall filled with air, for example, which is considered a bad conductor). In contrast, if the container walls were made of a thin sheet of metal, which is considered a good conductor, we say that the system and the environment are in *thermal contact*, or that they can exchange heat. When the system and the environment are in thermal contact, we say that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its environment if

$$T_{e}= T_{s}.$$

When a system and its environment are separated by a movable wall, this wall will we shifted if there is a pressure difference. In this case, the system is in mechanical equilibrium with the environment if

$$P_{e}= P_{s}$$

Quite generally, if two systems with temperatures $T_{1}$ and$T_{2}$, and pressures $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are in equilibrium which each other, then

$$
\begin{align}
T_{1}= T_{2}\\[1em]
P_{1}= P_{2}
\end{align}
$$

This equilibrium can only be reached if the two systems are able to "talk" to each other (that is, transfer heat or do work), hence, we need thermal contact and movable walls to achieve equilibrium.

There is also a chemical equilibrium, but in this course, we assume that our walls do not allow the exchange of particles.
