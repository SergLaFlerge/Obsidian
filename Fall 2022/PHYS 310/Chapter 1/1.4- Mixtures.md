# Mixtures

Mixtures of several chemical compounds are straightforward to treat within thermodynamics, but due to the increased number of thermodynamic variables, they are a little unwieldy. Here we collect some basic facts.

For a homogeneous macroscopic system that is a mixture of $X$ different chemical compounds, we associate particle numbers $N^{(j)}$ to each of the compounds labeled by an index $j = 1,... X$. The concentration of component $j$ is given by

$$c^{(j)}= \frac{N^{(j)}}{N},$$

With

$$\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{X}N^{(j)}&= N,\\[1em]
\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{X}c^{(j)}&= 1.
\end{align}
$$

 Note that $X = 4$. The relative particle number density of component $j$ is

$$n^{(j)}= \frac{N^{(j)}}{V}= c^{(j)}n,$$

With $n = N/V$ the total particle number  density. The temperature of the homogeneous system shall be $T$. Each component $j$ has an equation of state $\phi^{(j)}(n^{(j)}, P^{(j)}, T)= 0$ that is independent of the remaining chemical compounds. If we assume that the interactions between the chemical components $j$ is approximately absent (this need not be the case), then these equations of state remain valid and the *partial pressure* $P^{(j)}$ of the jth component is found from solving

$$\phi^{(j)}(n^{(j)}, P^{(j)}, T)= 0\; \text{for each}\; j.$$

The total pressure is

$$\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{X}P^{(j)}= P.$$

A complete set of thermodynamic variables of the mixture is then

$$(n^{(1)},..., n^{(X)}, P^{(1)},..., P^{(X)}, T).$$  

Note also that in general each component $j$ has a different mass, $m^{(j)}$, and so $\rho^{(j)}= m^{(j)}n^{(j)}$ for the mass density.
