# Application of the First Law to Gases

Recall that we earlier we said that the expression

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}
$$

Makes no sense, as we need to indicate whether $V$ or $P$ is held fixed. However, for an ideal gas, both expressions actually agree,

$$
C_{V}= \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_{V} \overset{\text{ideal gas}}{=}\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_{P}.
$$

When expressed in terms of the variables $(V, T)$  or $(P, T)$, the energy of an ideal gas is a function of $T$ alone,

$$
E (V, T)= E (P, T)= E (T).
$$

As usual, we consider $N$  as a constant, another way to write this is

$$
dE = C_{V}dT.
$$

Using the experimental fact that $C_{V}$ of an ideal gas only slightly depends on temperature, we can integrate the above equation and obtain

$$
E (T)= C_{V}T.
$$

We have set the integration constant $E_{0}$, which would be the energy at $T = 0$, to zero.

Next we compute $C_{P}$ for the ideal gas. Recall that

$$
C_{P}= \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_{P}+ P \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{P}.
$$

The first term is identical to $C_{V}$ for an ideal gas. For the second term we use $PV = Nk_{B}T$ to arrive at

$$
\begin{align}
C_{P} & = \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_{V}+ P \frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{Nk_{B}T}{P}\right)\\[1em]
& = C_{V}+ Nk_{B}.
\end{align}
$$
