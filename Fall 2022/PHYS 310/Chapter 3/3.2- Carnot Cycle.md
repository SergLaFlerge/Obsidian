# Carnot Cycle

We defined a *heat bath* or *heat reservoir* as a large body of temperature $T$ that contains so many particles that its temperature does not change when it is coupled to a system. It is used to bring and keep the system at temperature $T$ through thermal contact and heat transfer.

In principle, the heat bath could exchange both heat $Q$ and work $W$ with the system. If the heat bath is such that it cannot perform work on the system, it is called a *heat source*.

A system may be coupled to several heat reservoirs, or to different reservoirs at the same time. The *Carnot cycle* uses two heat sources, with temperatures $T_{1}< T_{2}$. It is a reversible cycle built from two isothermal lines and two adiabatic lines, intersecting at four points $A, B, C, D$. We use variables $(V, T)$ to label these states.

Consider a system whose initial state is $A$, with volume $V_{A}$ at temperature $T_{2}$. The Carnot cycle is the following set of transformations that are supposed to be performed reversibly.

- $A \rightarrow B$. Isothermal expansion to volume $V_{B}$ at fixed temperature $T_{2}$.
- $B \rightarrow C$. Adiabatic expansion to volume $V_{C}$. During that, temperature decreases to $T_{1}$.
- $C \rightarrow D$. Isothermal compression to volume $V_{D}$ at fixed temperature $T_{1}$.
- $D \rightarrow A$. Adiabatic compression to volume $V_{A}$. During that, temperature increases to $T_{2}$.

Important for the Carnot cycle is that these transformations are performed reversibly, i.e. slow enough so that the system is infinitesimally close to an equilibrium state at each intermediate step.

## Heat and Work

During the isothermal expansion $A \rightarrow B$, the system absorbs an amount of heat $Q_{2}> 0$ from the source $T_{2}$. Similarly, during the isothermal compression $C \rightarrow D$, it releases an amount of heat $Q_{1}> 0$ to the source $T_{1}$. No heat is transferred in the adiabatic sections. Hence the total amount of heat absorbed by the system during the cycle is $Q_{2}-Q_{1}$. The amount of work done $L$ during one cycle, given by the area enclosed in the $PV-$diagram, follows from the first law for cycles to be

$$
L = Q_{2}-Q_{1}.
$$

This equation means that only a fraction of the heat absorbed from the hot source at $T_{2}$ is transferred into work $L$ in the Carnot cycle. The part $Q_{1}$, instead of being transformed into work, is surrendered to the source at temperature $T_{1}$. We define the *efficiency* of the Carnot cycle as the ratio

$$
\eta = \frac{L}{Q_{2}}
$$

It represents the fraction of heat that is converted into work. It can be rewritten as

$$
\eta = 1-\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}}
$$

For the Carnot cycle, so the portion $\propto Q_{1}$ is not transformed into work.

Since the Carnot cycle is reversible, it can be run in the opposite direction. It then absorbs the work $L$, and absorbs the amount of heat $Q_{1}$ from the colder source $T_{1}$, whereas it gives up the amount of heat $Q_{2}$ to the  hotter source $T_{2}$.
