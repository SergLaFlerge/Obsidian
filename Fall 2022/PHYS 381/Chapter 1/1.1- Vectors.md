# Vectors

We start this course, unsurprisingly, with vectors (*yay*)

We are gonna skip a bunch of stuff and start with Levi-Civita symbols.

- Levi-Civita symbols $\epsilon_{ijk}$ are defined by: $\epsilon_{123}= \epsilon_{231}= \epsilon_{312}= 1, \; \epsilon_{213}= \epsilon_{132}= \epsilon_{321}=-1$, and $\epsilon_{ijk}= 0$ for any other  combination of indices. Note the cyclic nature of the Levi-Civita symbol. The Levi-Civita symbol doesn't change under cyclic or even permutations, and changes sign under odd permutations.
- The components of a vector product between two vectors can be written in terms of a summation to over indices using the Levi-Civita symbol as $$(\vec{a}\times \vec{b})_{i}= \sum\limits_{jk}\epsilon_{ijk}a_{j}b_{k}$$  or, using Einstein's summation convention in which a summation is made over repeated indices, $$(\vec{a}\times \vec{b})_{i}= \epsilon_{ijk}a_{j}b_{k}$$
- Using the summation convention for repeated indices, a useful relation involving $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is $$\epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{ilm}=\delta_{jl}\delta_{km}-\delta_{jm}\delta_{kl}$$ where $\delta_{ij}$ are the Kronecker  deltas.
- You know what a Kronecker delta is
-  A useful vector identity is $$(\vec{A}\times \vec{B})\times \vec{C}= \vec{A}\cdot \vec{C}\cdot \vec{B}-\vec{B}\cdot \vec{C}\cdot \vec{A}$$
- The surface area of a parallelogram subtended with two non-parallel vectors $\vec{v}_{1}$ and $\vec{v}_{2}$ is given by $$|\vec{v}_{1} \times \vec{v}_{2}|.$$
- The surface area of a triangle with summits $A, B, C$ is given by $$S_{\Delta}= \frac{1}{2} |\vec{AB}\times \vec{AC}|$$
-  The volume of a polyhedron with three pairs of parallel faces, subtended by three linearly dependent vectors $\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c}$ is given by $$V =|\vec{a}\cdot (\vec{b}\times \vec{c})|$$ is
