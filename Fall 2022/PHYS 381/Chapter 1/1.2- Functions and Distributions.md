## Derivatives of Discontinuous Vector Fields

In the coming chapters, we will be considering vector fields in materials which properties the may vary smoothly in some areas, and abruptly at boundaries. It will be necessary to calculate the divergence and curl of these vector fields while accounting for discontinuities at the material boundaries. For example, if we consider a certain volume $\mathcal{V}$ in which there is a vector field $\vec{P}$, and outside of which $\vec{P}= 0$. Assuming that $\vec{s}$ represents a point on the surface, and that very close to the boundary, the surface is locally planar, the vector field near the surface can be written as

$$\vec{P}=  \vec{\mathcal{P}}H (-(\vec{r}-\vec{s})\cdot \hat{n}),$$

Where $\hat{n}$ is a unit vector locally perpendicular the the you surface, and pointing out said the volume. Note here that the discontinuity is accounted for with the Heaviside function $H$, and therefore in the vicinity  of the surface, $\vec{\mathcal{P}}$can be treated as a constant vector field. Using the chain rule for derivatives, the divergence of $\vec{P}$ is then found to be

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{P}= H' (-(\vec{r}-\vec{s})\cdot \hat{n})\vec{P}\cdot{n}=-\delta ((\vec{r}-\vec{s})\cdot \hat{n})\vec{P}\cdot \hat{n},$$

Where use is made of $\nabla (\vec{r}\cdot \hat{n})= \hat{n}$. The divergence of $\vec{P}$ at the surface can therefore with seen as a surface density ; that is a certain amount of a given physical quantity per unit surface area, without any extent in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Equivalently, this can be seen as a singular volume density function (because of the presence of the delta function).

Similarly, the curl of a vector field $\vec{P}$ at the outer boundary of a volume in which the vector is non zero, and zero outside ; that is, discontinuous at the outer boundary, is

$$\nabla \times \vec{P}= H' (-(\vec{r}-\vec{s})\cdot \hat{n})\hat{n}\times \vec{\mathcal{P}}=-\delta ((\vec{r}-\vec{s})\cdot \hat{n})\cdot \hat{n}\times \vec{\mathcal{P}}.$$

Here also, the curl of $\vec{P}$ at a surface can be seen as a surface quantity, or equivalently, as a singular THOL density at the surface.
