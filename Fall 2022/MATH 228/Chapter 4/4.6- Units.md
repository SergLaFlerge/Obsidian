# Units
Let $R$ be a [[4.3- Commutative and Unital Rings#Unital Rings|unital ring]]. An element $a \in R$ is called a *unit* if there are $b, c \in R$ such that $ba = ac= 1_{R}$. The set of units in $R$ is denoted $R^{\times}$.

#### Proposition 6.1

If $a \in R^{\times}$, then the elements $b, c \in R$ such that $ba = ac = 1_{R}$ are unique and are equal to each other.

**Proof:** $b = b \cdot 1_{R}= b (ac)= (ba)c = 1_{R}\cdot c = c$.

We call the unique $b \in R$ such that $ba = ab = 1_{R}$the *inverse* of $a$ (or, for emphasis, the *multiplicative inverse*). It is denoted $a^{-1}$. Thus, $a^{-1}a = aa^{-1}= 1_{R}$.

## Cancellation of Units

If $a \in R^{\times}$ and $b, c \in R$, then

$$
\begin{align}
ab = ac & \Rightarrow b = c, \\
ba = ca & \Rightarrow b = c.
\end{align}
$$

Indeed, if $ab = ac$, then $a^{-1}ab = a^{-1}ac$, so $1_{R}\cdot b = 1_{R}\cdot c$, i.e., $b = c$. The second equality is proven similarly.

## Units in Commutative Rings

If $R$ is commutative, then $a \in R$ is a unit if and only if there is $b \in R$ such that $ba = 1_{R}$. That is, we do not need to check separately that $ab = 1_{R}$, because $ab = ba$.

## Examples of Units in Rings

1. $\mathbb{Z}^{\times}= \{-1, 1\}$. That is, the only units in the ring of integers are $1$ and $-1$.
2. $\mathbb{Q}= \mathbb{Q}\smallsetminus \{0 \}$. That is, every non-zero rational number is a unit in $\mathbb{Q}$. Similarly, $\mathbb{R}^{\times}= \mathbb{R}\smallsetminus\{0 \}$.
3. If $f \in \mathcal{F}$, then $f$ is a unit if and only if $f (x)$ is non-zero for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Thus, the function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ defined by $f (x)= x^{2}+1$ is a unit in $\mathcal{F}$, and its inverse (as an element of $\mathcal{F}$) is the function $g \in \mathcal{F}$ defined by $g (x)= 1/(x^{2}+ 1)$. Indeed, $(f \cdot g)(x)= f (x)g (x)= (x^{2}+ 1)/(x^{2}+ 1) = 1$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. By contrast, the function $h (x)= (x-1)^{3}$ is not a unit, because $h (1)= 0$.
4.  The units in the ring $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ are the invertible $n \times n$ matrices, or equivalently, the ones with non-zero determinant. The set of invertible $n \times n$ matrices is denoted $GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})$. For example, $$\begin{pmatrix}2&1 \\ 3&8\end{pmatrix}\in GL_{2}(\mathbb{R}), \quad \begin{pmatrix}2&1 \\6 & 3\end{pmatrix}\notin GL_{2}(\mathbb{R}).$$
