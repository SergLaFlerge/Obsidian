# Subrings and Products

Let $R$ be a ring. A *subring* of $R$ is a subset of $R$ that is itself a ring with respect to the same operations of addition and multiplication in $R$. For example, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\mathbb Q$.

## Proposition 8.1

Let $R$ be a ring and $\mathcal{S}$ a subset of $R$. Then $\mathcal{S}$ is a subring of $R$ if and only if all of the following hold:

1.  $\mathcal{S}$ is non-empty
2.  For all $a, b \in \mathcal{S}$, $a-b \in \mathcal{S}$. (closure under subtraction)
3.  For all $a, b, \in \mathcal{S}$, $ab \in \mathcal{S}$. (closure under  multiplication)

**Example:** Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $\mathcal{S}= \{A \in M_{n}(\mathbb{R}|\; A \text{is upper triangular}\}$. $\mathcal{S}$ is a subring of $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$. It is non-empty because, for example, the zero $n \times n$ matrix is upper triangular. It is closed under subtraction because if $A = (a_{ij})$ and $B = (b_{ij})$ are both upper triangular, then $A + B$ is also triangular. Further, the $(i, j)$-entry of $AB$ is

$$
\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}a_{i, k}b_{k, j},
$$

and if $i > j$, then every $k \in \{1, ..., n\}$ satisfies either $k < i$, in which case $a_{i, k}= 0$, or $k \geq i > k$, in which case $b_{k, j}= 0$, so $AB$ is upper triangular.
