# Commutative and Unital Rings

Many of the [[4.1- Binary Operations and the Definition of a Ring#Definition of a Ring|rings]] we study in this course will have one one or both of the following common properties.

## Commutative Rings

A ring $R$ is called *commutative* if its multiplication operation is commutative, i.e., if $a \cdot b = b \cdot a\; \forall a, b \in R$.

## Unital Rings

A ring $R$ is called *unital* if there is an element $1 \in R$ such that, for all $a \in R$,

$$
1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a.
$$

#### Proposition 3.1

If $R$ is a unital ring, then the element $1$ satisfying $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$ for all $a \in R$ unique.

**Proof:** Suppose $1, 1' \in R$ satisfy $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$ and $1' \cdot a = a \cdot 1' = a$ for all $a \in R$. Then $1' = 1 \cdot 1' = 1$, the first equality because $1$ has the property in question, and the second because $1'$ does.

The unique element $1$ satisfying $1 \cdot a= a \cdot 1 = a$ for all $a \in R$ is called the *identity* element of $R$, are the *multiplicative identity element*. Therefore, a unital ring is sometimes also called a *ring with identity*.

We often denote the identity element in a unital ring by $1_{R}$.

**Caution:** Many books include the existence of a multiplicative identity in the very definition of a ring. When you are reading a book that discusses rings, make sure to check how rings are defined so that you know whether the author is assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity or not.

If $R$ is a unital ring, then we emphasize that

$$
\begin{align}
1_{R}\cdot a = a \cdot 1 & = a \\
1a & = a
\end{align}
$$

If $a$ is an element of a unital ring $R$, we define $a^{0}=1_{R}$ no matter what $a$ is, even when $a = 0_{R}$.
