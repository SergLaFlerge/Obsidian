# Functions

If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, a *function* (or a *map*) is a rule $f$ that assigns each element of $x \in X$ one, and only one, element of $Y$, denoted $f (x)$. The set $X$ is called the *domain* $f$, and the set $Y$ is called the *codomain* of $f$. We write $f:X \rightarrow Y$ to specify that $f$ is a function with domain $X$ and codomain $Y$. The symbol $\mapsto$ is used to specify where an element of $X$ is mapped to under the given function. Some examples:

1. $$f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow  \mathbb{Q},\quad a \mapsto a/2$$
3. $$g:\mathbb{R}_{> 0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R},\quad x \mapsto \ln (x)$$
5. $$h:\mathbb{Z}^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R},\quad (a, b)\mapsto a + b\sqrt{2}$$

## Image

If $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a function, its image is

$$\text{Image}(f)= \{y \in Y|\; \exists  \;x \in X \; \text{such that}f (x) \in Y\}= \{f (x)|\; x \in X\}.$$

For example, if we define$f:\mathbb{R}\smallsetminus\{0\}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $x \mapsto x^{2}$,

$$\text{Image}(f)= \{f (x)|\; x \in \mathbb{R}\smallsetminus \{0\}\}= \{x^{2}|\; x \in \mathbb{R}\smallsetminus \{0 \}\}= \{y \in \mathbb{R}|\; y < 0\}= \mathbb{R}_{ >0}.$$

## Composing Functions

If  $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y \rightarrow Z$ are functions, then their composition $f\circ g$ is the function

$$\begin{align}
g \circ f:X  &\rightarrow Z\\[1em]
x &\mapsto g (f (x))
\end{align}
$$

For example, if

$$\begin{align}
f:\mathbb{Z}\smallsetminus \{0 \}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\[1em]

x \mapsto x^{2},\\[2em]

g:\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\\[1em]

y \mapsto \ln (y),
\end{align}
$$

Then $g \circ f:\mathbb{Z}\smallsetminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the function $x \mapsto \ln (x^{2}).$

Compositions of functions are *associative* meaning that if we have three functions $f, \; g, \; h$,

$$(f \circ g)\circ h = f \circ (g \circ h)= f \circ g \circ h$$
So we usually just stick to the last one.

## Identity Function

To any set $X$, we assign a special function, called the *identity map* on $X$. Denoted $\mathbf{1}_{X}$, this is the function that maps  $X$ to itself that sends every element of $X$ to itself.  In symbols,

$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{1}_{X}:X \rightarrow X \\[1 em]

x \mapsto x.
\end{align}
$$

## Injectivity, Surjectivity, and Bijectivity

A function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is called

- *injective* if, for all $x_{1}, \; x_{2}\in X$, the equality $f (x_{1})= f (x_{2})\Leftrightarrow x_{1}= x_{2}.$
- *surjective* if, for all $y \in Y$, there is $x \in X$ such that $f (x)= y$.
- *bijective* if, for all $y \in Y$, there is a *unique* $x \in X$ such that $f (x)= y$.

Note that a function is bijective if and only if it is both injective and surjective. Another way to describe surjectivity is by reference to the image. Specifically, $f$ is surjective if and only if $\text{Image}(f)= Y$.

Example: $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ that sends $x$ to $x^{2}$ is injective, because if $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are non-negative real numbers whose squares are equal, then $x_{1}= x_{2}$. However, $f$ is not surjective, because there are real numbers that are not in the image of $f$.

Example: on the other hand, $g:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is not injective, because we have $x_{1}\neq x_{2}$ such that $f (x_{1})= f (x_{2})$. However, because $g$ restricts the codomain to the positive real numbers, $g$ is surjective.

## Proposition 2.1

Let $X$ and $Y$ be non-empty sets and let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be a function.

1. $f$ is injective if and only if there is $g:X \rightarrow Y$ such that $g \circ f = \mathbf{1}_{X}$.
2. $f$ is surjective if and only if there is $h:Y \rightarrow X$ such that $f \circ h = \mathbf{1}_X$
3. $f$is bijective if and only if there is $g:Y \rightarrow X$ such that $f \circ g = \mathbf{1}_{Y}$ and $g \circ f = \mathbf{1}_{X}$.
