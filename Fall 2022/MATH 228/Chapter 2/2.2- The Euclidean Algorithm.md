# The Euclidean Algorithm

Let $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ be positive integers whose greatest common divisor we wish to find. We know we can write

$$a_{0}= q_{1}a_{1}+ a_{2}$$

With $q_{1}, a_{2}\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \leq a_{2}\leq a_{1}$. From above, we see that any common divisor of $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ is a common divisor of $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, and vice versa. Therefore, $\text{gcd}(a_{0}, a_{1})= \text{gcd}(a_{1}, a_{2})$. This may not appear to be a gain at first sight, because we seem only to have we placed one pair of integers with another. Bet note that $a_{2}< a_{1}$, and if $a_{2}can \neq 0$, we may repeat the above to write

$$a_{1}= q_{2}a_{2}+ a_{3}$$

With $0 \leq a_{3}< a_{2}$, and so on, until eventually some $a_{n}$ must be $0$. The final step would therefore say $a_{n-2}= q_{n-1}a_{n-1}$, so

$$\text{gcd}(a_{0}, a_{1})= \text{gcd}(a_{1}, a_{2})= \text{gcd}(a_{2}, a_{3})= \cdots = \text{gcd}(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1})= a_{n-1}.$$

**Example:** Let us find $\text{gcd}(142, 66)$ by the Euclidean algorithm

Because $2|4$, we see that $\text{gcd}(142, 66)= 2$. It is not necessary to write out the final step, $4 = 2 \cdot 2 + 0$.

## Expressing $\text{gcd}(a, b)$ in Terms of $a$ and $b$

Recall from [[2.1- Division and Greatest Common Divisors#Theorem 1.2 G C D Theorem|Theorem 1.2]] that there are $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\text{gcd}(a, b)= ma + nb$. It is possible to extend the algorithm above to find such integers. We illustrate how by continuing with the example above, in which $a = 142$ and $b = 66$:

The term *Euclidean algorithm* may refer either to the process of either finding the greatest common divisor or to the process of expressing the greatest common divisor in terms of the original integers, but commonly the term means both stages combined. More examples in the course notes.
