# Arc Length

Recall that, given a vector $\mathbf{v}= (v_{1},..., v_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, its *length* is

$$||\mathbf{v}||= \sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+... + v_{n}^{2}}.$$

If $\mathbf{u}$ is another vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $||\mathbf{v-u}||$ is the length of the straight line segment joining the two points $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

To find the arc length of the parameterized curve $\gamma$, note that, if $\delta t$ is small enough, the image of $\mathcal{C}$ between $\gamma (t)$ and $\gamma (t + \delta t)$ is nearly a straight line, so the length is approximately 

$$||\gamma (t + \delta t)-\gamma (t)||.$$

Again, since $\delta t$ is small, $(\gamma (t +\delta t)-\gamma (t))/\delta t$ is nearly equal to $\dot{\gamma}(t)$, so the length is approximately

$$||\dot{\gamma}||\delta t.$$

If we want to calculate a (not necessarily small) part of $\mathcal{C}$, we can divide it into segments, each corresponding to a small increment $\delta t$, and add up all the results. As $\delta t$ tends to zero, we get the exact length of $\gamma (t)$.

This motivates the following definition:

### Definition: Arc Length

The *arc length* of a curve, from point $t_{0}$ to $t$ is the function $s (t)$ given by

$$s (t)= \int_{t_{0}}^{t}||\dot{\gamma}(u)||du.$$

Thus, $s (t_{0})= 0$, and $s (t)$ is positive or negative depending on whether $t$ is greater or smaller than $t_{0}$.

## Example 1

For a logarithmic spiral, $\gamma (t)= (e^{kt}\cos t,e^{kt}\sin t)$, where $k$ is a non-zero constant, we have

$$ \begin{align}
\dot{\gamma}(t)&= (e^{kt}(k \cos t-\sin t), e^{kt}(k \sin t + \cos t)) \\
\therefore||\dot{\gamma}||^{2}&= e^{2kt}(k \cos t-\sin t)^{2}+ e^{2kt}(k \sin t + \cos t)^{2}= (k^{2}+ 1)e^{2kt}.
\end{align}
$$

So the arc length of $\gamma$, starting from $\gamma (0)= (0, 1)$ (for example) is

$$s = \int_{0}^{t}\sqrt{k^{2}+ 1}e^{kt}du = \frac{\sqrt{k^{2}+ 1}}{k}(e^{kt}-1).$$

The arc length is a differentiable function. If $s (t)$ is the arc length of a curve $\gamma$ starting at $\gamma (t_{0})$, we have

$$\frac{ds}{dt}= \frac{d}{dt}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}||\dot{\gamma}||du =||\dot{\gamma(t)}||.$$

If we think of $\gamma(t)$ as the position of a moving point at time $t$, $ds/dt$ can be thought of as the *speed* of the point at time $t$ (or the rate of change of distance along the curve). This suggests the following definition

### Definition: Speed

If $\gamma:(\alpha, \beta)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a parameterized curve, its *speed* at the point $\gamma (t)$ is $||\dot{\gamma}(t)||$, and $\gamma$ is said to be a *unit speed curve* if $\dot{\gamma}(t)$ is a unit vector for all $t \in (\alpha, \beta)$. 

We will see many examples of formulas and results relating to curves that take on a simpler form when the curve is unit-speed. The reason for this simplification is given in the next proposition. Although at first sight this looks uninteresting, it will with extremely useful for what follows.

We recall that the *dot product* of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is

$$\mathbf{a \cdot b}= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}.$$

If $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are smooth functions of a parameter $t$, we can make use of the "product formula"

$$\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{a \cdot b})= \frac{d \mathbf{a}}{dt}\mathbf{b}+ \frac{d \mathbf{b}}{dt}\mathbf{a}.$$

This follows from the definition of the dot product and the usual product formula for scalar functions

$$\frac{d}{dt}(a_{i}b_{i})= \frac{da_{i}}{dt}b_{i}+ \frac{db_{i}}{dt}{a_{i}}.$$

### Proposition 1.2.4

Let $\mathbf{n}(t)$ be a unit vector that is a smooth function of a parameter $t$. Then, the dot product

$$\dot{\mathbf{n}}(t)\cdot \mathbf{n}(t)= 0$$

For all $t$.

In particular, if $\gamma$ is a speed curve, then $\ddot{\gamma}= 0.$ 

#### Proof

Using the product formula to differentiate both sides of the equation $\mathbf{n \cdot n}= 1$with respect to $t$ gives

$$\dot{\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{n}}+ \mathbf{n}\dot{\mathbf{n}}= 0,$$

So $2 \dot{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \mathbf{n}= 0$. The last part follows by taking $\mathbf{n}= \dot{\gamma}.$
