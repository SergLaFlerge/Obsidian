## Swimmer 6 Workout
300 m total:
- 50 m warmup using any stroke
- 4 $\times$ 25 m front crawl with 15 second rests
- 4 $\times$ 25 m back crawl with 15 second rests
- 50 m cooldown using any stroke

The wave pool is 50 m so instead of 4 $\times$ 25 we can do 2 $\times$ 50 with 30 second rests.

Small presentation to introduce the workout, emphasizing pacing so as to not get tired. After the workout, we can discuss any stroke improvement (CLM 9.2 and Appendix C).

### Strategies

Keep presentation short, 'tis but a simple workout. Pacing is important specially with kids around this age who are just learning about it. Do a half-circle presentation and evaluate them all at once in the wave pool.

#### CLM 9.2/Appendix C

Read up on front and back crawl actions, recovery, and breathing, located in pages 9-2 to 9-6.

## Star Patrol Item 3

Ready position:
- Body facing victim, legs ready to kick away
-  Attentive to victim's movements

Constant communication with the victim as important; explain that they must not try to hold on to you. Always be watchful about the possibility of being grabbed.

Defenses and releases:
- Duck away from front or rear
- Foot/arm block.

Both of these are found in CLM 5-3. Highlight that the arm block is *very risky* and should only be used as a last resort. These are also not techniques per se, but rather strategies, as there is no guarantee that any one of these will work.

**Must Sees:**

- [ ] Avoidance of grasps
- [ ] Ready position at a safe distance
- [ ] Constructive communication
- [ ] Treading water throughout

### Strategies

Demonstrations are key here; make sure to go over at least a couple of the techniques. Staggered wave practice would be preferable, but for lack of time, having them split into pairs will work as well.

A "let go" signal will be very important, particularly if candidates decide to try

### Learning  Activities

Page 63 of swim patrol award guide "Knights of the round pool."

Candidates are paired up, and one is given a lifejacket, which they will hold in front of them like a shield. Partners take turns performing defenses from a ready position. They should practice the foot and arm block, and they can also practice quick submerges. For added challenge, the candidate holding the lifejacket can approach their partner from the side or rear. After whichever method is used, the defender should back-crawl and assume ready position before switching with the victim. A variation of this game has the victims try and tag the defenders instead. This can be practiced as well should they feel comfortable in their skills.

Try this out in chest deep water first to build confidence.

## Bronze Medallion Item 18

Page 33 of the Bronze Medals award guide. Non-contact rescue of a tired or weak swimmer in open water with a towing aid. 20 m approach and 20 m tow to safety. The goal is obviously to rescue the victim, but it should be done with minimal risk to the rescuer; as the description says, *no contact*. Guard tubes will be provided for this drill, but it should be noted that in real life, a pair of pants can do wonders. Due to time constraints we shall only see one or two rescues but realistically everyone would have a chance. Go over must-sees and pick a couple peeps to do the drill.

### Strategies

A demonstration will be best. Go over must-sees and then demo. Then we can pick a couple people to practice and give feedback to. For this reason a staggered wave will work best me thinks.

## Assistant Lifeguard Scenarios

Cove bottom, you are watching your slides when you see a child walking around shivering. When you approach them, you see their lips are blue and they are cold to the touch. Their guardians are nowhere to be seen.

The rescuer should notice the signs of hypothermia and call a lifeguard for assistance. They should ask where their guardian is and when the kid answers they don't know, they should keep them close and inform the lifeguard. There will be a towel provided for the rescuer to give to the kid, and the hot tub will be part of the scenario should they go that route.

### Strategies

Most of these are final shows of skill, so strategies for all of them involve very little. There will be an introduction talking about what we'll be doing but otherwise it is up to the class to know what they are doing past being told about the scenario. Naturally there will be feedback on the group that does the scenario at the end with input from the rest of the class


## "Swim with a buddy"

Point to [this infographic](https://www.lifesaving.org/public/download/files/190301).

Young adults aged 20-29 are the most likely to fatally drown, particularly males. One of the best ways to reduce that risk is to swim with a buddy. Even if they are untrained, they are able to call for help when you might not be able to yourself.

### Strategies

'Tis a short presentation, just  have them in a standard classroom set up, or if doing it in the park, a half circle will do wonders. Bring laptop to show infographic. Using real life stats helps to ground the message and gives it a "why" which is important for adults, so talking about the statistics in the graphic will make the message make sense.
