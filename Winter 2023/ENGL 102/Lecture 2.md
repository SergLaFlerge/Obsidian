# Fire and Ice

Some say the world will end in fire
some say in ice
from what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those what favor fire
but if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
to say this for destruction ice
is also great
and would suffice

So what is the author saying?

We are linking fire with desire, emotion, etc., and ice with hatred, neglect, isolation, stagnation. Fire is all consuming, but burns out eventually. Ice is slow but permanent.

The destruction of the world would be interpreted as more personal, or global.

When  writing inksheds, we must first interpret what the author is saying, and then we must formulate a response (yes, and, yes, but, no actually). Expand on details in text, bring in new details, further the conversation and invite more responses.

Not all inksheds will be good, and that's okay.

They just have to be done/started in class, but can be finished outside class.

They can be structured, but don't have to.
