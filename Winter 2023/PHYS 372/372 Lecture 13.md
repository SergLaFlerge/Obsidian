## Problem 1.4

In classical physics, you would not be given a temperature, whereas here, we are asking the which temperature you would experience quantum uncertainty, i.e.

$$
\sigma_{x}\sigma_{p}\geq \hbar.
$$

We can use a classical relation to relate the temperature to kinetic energy

$$
E_{k} = \frac{k_{B}T}{2},
$$

so even if you put your particle at the lowest energy state, you would still have some energy from the temperature. The whole point of the problem is figuring out the $x$-th and $p$-th component, i.e.

$$
xp \sim \hbar.
$$

After this, the problem is pretty simple. It is the logic that's the hard part of the  problem.

Classically,

$$
\begin{align}
F & =-kx \\
V & = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}\\
\omega & = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\\
E_{k} & = \frac{k_{B}T}{2} = \frac{p^{2}}{2m} = \frac{1}{2}kx_{0}^{2}
\end{align}
$$

Then you can solve for $x$ and $p$ in terms of the temperature which multiplied together is of the order of $\hbar$. It should be around $\order{10^{-10}}$.
