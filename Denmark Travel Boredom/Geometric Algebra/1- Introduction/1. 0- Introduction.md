# Introduction

The goal of expressing geometrical relationships through algebraic equations has dominated much of the development of mathematics. This goes back all the way to the ancient Greeks, who constructed a set of geometric laws to describe the world as they saw it. Their view of geometry was largely unchallenged until the eighteenth century. When mathematics discovered new geometries with different properties from the Greeks' *Euclidean* geometry. Each of these had different geometric properties, and a major part of nineteenth century  mathematicians was to unify these geometries under one algebraic framework. W. K. Clifford made one of the key insights it in this process, and this book is concerned with the implications of his discovery.
