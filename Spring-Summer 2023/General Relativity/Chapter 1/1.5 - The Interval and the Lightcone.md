# The Interval and the Lightcone

Consider two events $A$ and $B$ which have the same coordinates $(t'_{A}, x'_{A}, y'_{A}, z'_{A})$ and $(t'_{B}, x'_{B}, y'_{B}, z'_{B})$ in $S'$. Then the interval between the events is given by

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta s^{2} & = c^{2}\Delta t'\,^{2}-\Delta x'\,^{2}-\Delta y'\,^{2}-\Delta z'\,^{2} \\
& =[(c \Delta t)\cosh \psi-(\Delta x)\sinh \psi]^{2}-[-(c \Delta t)\sinh \psi + (\Delta x)\cosh \psi]^{2} -\Delta y^{2} -\Delta z^{2} \\
& = c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta x^{2}-\Delta y^{2}-\Delta z^{2}.
\end{align}
$$

So the interval is invariant under the Lorentz boost, and so we may infer that $\Delta s^{2}$ is in fact invariant under *any* [Poincare transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group#Poincar%C3%A9_symmetry). Therefore this interval must be an underlying property of spacetime itself, i.e. in an variant "distance" between events in spacetime. The sign of $\Delta s^{2}$ must also be defined invariantly, as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{for}\; \Delta s^{2} &> 0 \qc \text{the interval is timelike}, \\
\text{for}\; \Delta s^{2} &= 0 \qc \text{the interval is null, or lightlike}, \\
\text{for} \; \Delta s^{2} & < 0 \qc \text{the interval is spacelike}.
\end{align}
$$

This corresponds to the standard lightcone structure shown below:

The geometrical distinction between timelike and spacelike is in fact a physical one: if the interval is *timelike* then there exists an inertial reference frame in which the events occur *at the same spatial coordinates*, and if the interval is *spacelike* then we can find an inertial reference frame in which the events occur *at the same time coordinate*.

In our lightcone figure, events $A$ and $B$ are timelike separated, while $A$ and $D$ are spacelike separated. Events $A$ and $C$ are lightlike separated, and is a limiting case that we shall talk about another time.
