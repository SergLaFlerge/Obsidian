# Spacetime Diagrams

Our previous figure was an example of a *spacetime diagram*. These diagrams are very useful in illustrating many special-relativistic effects directly, such as the coordinate transformations on the Minkowski spacetime between different inertial reference frames. The spacetime that I may or may not draw below shows the change of coordinates of an event $A$ corresponding to the standard-configuration Lorentz transformation. The $x'$-axis is simply the line $t' = 0$ and the $t'$-axis is the line $x' = 0$. From the Lorentz boost we see that the angle between $x$ and $x'$ axes is the same as the angle between $t$ and $t'$ axes, which has the value $\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{v}{c} \right)$. Moreover, we note that the $t$ and $t'$ axes are also the *worldlines* of the origins of $S$ and $S'$ respectively.

It is important to note that the coordinates of the event $A$ in the frame of $S'$ are *not* obtained by extending perpendicular lines from $A$ to the $x'$ and $t'$-axes. Since the $x'$-axis is simply the line $t' = 0$, it follows that the lines of simultaneity in $S'$ are parallel to the $t'$-axis. The same reasoning is equally valid for obtaining the coordinates of $A$ in the frame $S$ but, since the $x$- and $t$- axes are drawn as orthogonal in the diagram, this is equivalent to simply extending perpendiculars from $A$ to the $x$- and $t$- axes in the more familiar manner.

The concept of simultaneity is simply illustrated using a spacetime diagram. For example, in Figure 1.5 we replot the events of Figure 1.3, together with the $x'$- and $t'$- axes corresponding to a Lorentz boost in the standard configuration at some velocity $v$. We see that the events $A$ and $D$, which are separated by a spacelike interval, lie on a line of constant $t'$ and so are *simultaneous* in $S'$. Evidently, $A$ and $D$ are not simultaneous in $S$; $D$ occurs at a later time than $A$. In a similar way, it is straightforward to find a standard configuration Lorentz boost such that the events $A$ and $B$, which are separated by a timelike interval, lie on a line of constant $x'$ and hence occur at the same spatial location in $S'$.
