# The Spacetime Geometry of Special Relativity

In special relativity, Einstein abandons the postulate of an absolute time and replaces it by the postulate that the *speed of light* $c$ *is the same in all inertial reference frames*. By applying this new postulate, together with the principle of relativity, we may obtain the *Lorentz transformations* connecting the coordinates of an event $P$ in two different Cartesian reference frames $S$ and $S'$.

Consider our two frames in the standard configuration, and consider a photon emitted from the origins of $S$ and $S'$ at $t = 0$ and travel in an arbitrary direction. In each frame, the space and time coordinates of the photon must satisfy

$$
c^{2}t^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}= c^{2}t'^{2}-x'^{2}-y'^{2}-z'^{2}= 0.
$$

Substituting the original system of equations, and solving for $A$ and $B$, we obtain

$$
\begin{align}
ct' & = \gamma (ct-\beta x) \\[1 em]
x' & = \gamma (x-\beta ct) \\[1 em]
y' & = y \\[1 em]
z' & = z,
\end{align}
$$

where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ and $\gamma = (1-\beta^{2})^{-1/2}$. This Lorentz transformation, also known as a *boost* in the $x$-direction, reduces to the Galilean transformation when $\beta \ll1$.

From the equations, we see that the time and space coordinates are an general mixed by a Lorentz transformation. Moreover, if we consider two events $A$ and $B$ with coordinates $(t_{A}, x_{A}, y_{A}, z_{A})$ and $(t_{B}, x_{B}, y_{B}, z_{B})$ in $S$, one can show that the square of the interval

$$
\Delta s^{2}= c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta x^{2}-\Delta y^{2}-\Delta z^{2}
$$

is *invariant* under any Lorentz transformation. These observations lead us to think of space and time as united in a 4-dimensional continuum called *spacetime*, whose geometry is characterized by the above equation. Note that this spacetime is non-Euclidean because of the minus signs, and is therefore often called *pseudo-Euclidean* or *Minkowski* geometry. Nevertheless, for any fixed value of $t$, the spatial part of the geometry remains Euclidean.

This 4-dimensional world of the spacetime continuum shall be the one in which we explore and explain the many ideas of relativity, as this is the world in which they can be explained most simply.
