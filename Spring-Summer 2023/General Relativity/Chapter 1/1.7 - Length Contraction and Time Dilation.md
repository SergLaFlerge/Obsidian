# Length Contraction and Time Dilation 

Two elementary (but profound) consequences of the Lorentz transformations are length contraction and time dilation. Both of these effects are easily derived from the Lorentz transformations

## Length Contraction

Consider a rod of *proper length* $\ell_{0}$ at rest in $S'$. We then have

$$
\ell_{0} = x'_{B} - x'_{A}.
$$

We want to apply the Lorentz transformation formulae and so find what length an observer in frame $S$ assigns to the rod. Applying the second formula we obtain

$$
\begin{align}
x'_{A} & = \gamma (x_{A}-vt_{A}), \\[1 em]
x'_{B} & = \gamma (x_{B}-vt_{B}),
\end{align}
$$

relating the coordinates of the ends of the rod in $S'$ to the coordinates in $S$. The observer in $S$ measures the length of the rod at a *fixed time* $t = t_{A}= t_{B}$ as

$$
\begin{align}
\ell = x_{B}-x_{A} = \frac{1}{\gamma}\left(x'_{B}-x'_{A} \right) = \frac{\ell_{0}}{\gamma}.
\end{align}
$$

Hence in $S$ the rod appears contracted to the length

$$
\ell = \ell_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}.
$$

If a rod is moving relative to $S$ in a direction perpendicular to its length, however, it is straightforward to show that it suffers no contraction. It thus follows that the volume $V$ of a moving object, as measured by simultaneously noting the positions of the boundary points in $S$, is related to its *proper volume* $V_{0}$ by 

$$
V = V_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}.
$$

This fact must be taken into account when considering densities.
