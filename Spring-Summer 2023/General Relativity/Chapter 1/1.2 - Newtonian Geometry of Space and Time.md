# Newtonian Geometry of Space and Time

Newtonian theory is based on the assumption that there exists an absolute time that is the same for every observer; that is, $t' = t$. With this assumption, we find that $A = 1$ and $B = 0$ for the system of equations we had last chapter, and from these we obtain the *Galilean transformations* relating the coordinates of an event $P$ in the two Cartesian inertial reference frames $S$ and $S'$:

$$
\begin{align}
t' & = t \\[1 em]
x' & = x-vt \\[1 em]
y' & = y \\[1 em]
z' & = z.
\end{align}
$$

The first equation is clearly valid for any two inertial frames $S$ and $S'$, and shows that the time coordinate of an event $P$ is the same in all inertial reference frames. The second equation gives the "common sense" notion of addition of velocities. If a particle is moving in the $x$-direction at a speed $u$ in $S$, then its speed in $S'$ is given by

$$
u'_{x}= \dv{x'}{t'}= \dv{x'}{t}= \dv{x}{t}-v=_{x}-v.
$$

Differentiating again shows that the acceleration of a particle is the same in both $S$ and $S'$.

Consider two events $A$ and $B$ that have coordinates $(t_{A}, x_{A}, y_{A}, z_{A})$ and $(t_{B}, x_{B}, y_{B}, z_{B})$ respectively, it is relatively straightforward to show that the time difference $\Delta t = t_{B}-t_{A}$ and the quantity $\Delta r^{2}= \Delta x^{2}+ \Delta y^{2}+ \Delta z^{2}$ are *separately invariant* under *any* Galilean transformation, which leads one to have space and time as separate entities. Moreover, this invariance of $\Delta r^{2}$ suggests that it is a geometric property of space itself. We recognize this of course as the square of the distance between two events in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. This defines the *geometry* of space and time in the Newtonian picture.
