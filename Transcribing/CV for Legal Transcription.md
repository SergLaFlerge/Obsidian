# Introduction

We use the clean verbatim (CV) style for legal transcription. You need to stick to these rules for the legal prequalification exam.

## General Expectations

- Every file has a **styleguide** associated with it. Make sure you always have the latest one, i.e. download this document often.
- Try to capture **all** speech that is *relevant* to the file. You will learn to tag words you can't understand later.
- All names, companies, and terms must be spelled correctly and, more importantly, consistently. You should be using Google and any other tools to do good research.
- Obviously, you must have good grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Spell-check and proofread every file before submission.
- You **must** stick to the formatting rules on the style guide.
- Contact the help desk if there is anything unusual about a file (foreign languages, silent files, et cetera.)
## Difficult Audio

Sometimes audio is difficult for several reasons. Give your best effort when transcribing:

- Replay problematic areas multiple times. Change the audio speed or use an audio enhancer to help reduce any background noise if you can.
- Listen to the entire file at least twice. This helps by giving extra context and by getting accustomed to any accents.
- Read through the transcript without the audio to make sure you haven't written any nonsense. Never assume what you heard and wrote first is correct.
- Again, if you are still unsure of what is being said, you can use tags, described later.

# General Formatting

## Spacing Sentences

Use a regular space (1 space) to separate sentences. Shouldn't be a problem with steno.

## Changing Speakers

Every speaker is given a separate line. These are not paragraph breaks.

Usually, speaker IDs are used to make it easier to distinguish between different speakers. We will not be tested on speaker identification for the prequalification exam

## Q&A and Colloquy

There are two modes for speaker IDs:

- Colloquy is used for general conversation between parties. In this mode, each speaker is identified depending on their role. Lawyers use surnames (e.g. Mr. Smith), judges use titles (The Court), as well as someone giving a testimony (The Witness).
- The other mode is Q&A. This is used solely for when a sworn deponent or witness is being examined by a lawyer, investigator, or some other party legal allowed to elicit testimony. The questioner uses the **Q** tag, and **A** for the answerer.

## Objections

An objection is defined as "a formal protest to evidence, argument, or questions that are in violation of the rules of evidence or other procedural law." You will hear them often when transcribing, so it is good to familiarize yourself with them. Examples can be found in page 3 of the CV guide.

## Breaking Paragraphs

We also split long, single-speaker monologues into paragraphs when there is an obvious change in topic, or when a speaker is addressing someone else. You hit Enter *once* to create a new line. Paragraph sizes will vary, and it is subject to context and the transcriber's discretion. Generally, we consider a paragraph to be around 4-5 sentences long. Examples also in page 3 of the CV guide.

Additional paragraphs do not require further speaker IDs.

## General Spelling

We use American spelling and punctuation. In particular, we stick to these at Legal Phoenix:

- OK or ' Kay $\to$ okay.
- Alright $\to$ all right.
- Alot $\to$ a lot.
- etc. $\to$ et cetera.
- U. S. or U. S. A $\to$ US or USA.
- E-mail $\to$ email.
- Internet $\to$ internet (no capitalization).
- Health care $\to$ healthcare

## Oral Spelling

Individual letters are capitalized. If a speaker spells out a word, the letters are stringed together with hyphens. You should still write out the phonetic word if that is what they are giving. Example in page 5 of the CV guide.

## email Addresses

Formatted as per standard convention, even if the speaker spells out their email. If the speaker both says *and* spells out the address, then you should transcribe everything they say.

## Research

It is your responsibility to research any brand names and terms that are mentioned in the file to ensure they are formatted properly. By "formatted properly", we mean as written in the main text of a company's website (not the stylized logo.)

### Medication

Brand name medication has the first letter capitalized, even if the name is stylized in all caps. Generic drug names are not capitalized. Use drugs.com to distinguish between brand name and generic.

## Profanity and Trigger Warnings

Some files may cover graphic or disturbing content, and sometimes clients may not provide trigger warnings ahead of time. For this reason, make sure you've examined the file thoroughly before committing to it. While you may always cancel out of a file, repeated file abandonment is a violation of the team rules and will eventually earn you warnings from the admin team.

# CV for Legal

At TranscribeMe, the default transcription style is called **clean verbatim**. This style aims to clean up some of the speech to make it easier to read and avoids editing what was said. The most common features of speech that are cleaned up are stutters, stammers, informal pronunciation, and non verbal words.

## Conversation to Include

In CVL, we transcribe the main speaker(s) and their interactions with anyone else in the file. This typically means we end up focusing on the main events of a proceeding: witness testimony, lawyers giving arguments, et cetera. Sometimes it may be necessary to interrupt a main speaker's dialogue if someone else interrupts the flow of conversation.

### Automated Voices

Unless a main speaker responds to them, automated voices, such as those from answering machines, public address systems, or a device announcing that recording has begun. If a main speaker does respond to them, they are given their own speaker line.

If the speakers ignore the automated voice, you may also ignore it.

### Background Speakers

Same as with automated voices, only transcribe these if the main speakers interact with or acknowledge them. Whispered conversations between lawyers are typically not transcribed, and we avoid transcribing mutters and whispers from a speaker that is reading a document aloud *to themselves*.

In legal terms, unnecessary speech that is therefore not transcribed is referred to as **non-germane**.

## Stutters, Stammers, and Thinking Sounds

- Partial words and/or sounds are removed. Full words are kept.
- We replace mm-hmm or mm-mm with *uh-huh* and *uh-uh* respectively.
- Use *huh?* as a non-verbal response to indicate a speaker did not hear or understand something.

## Conjunctions and Interjections

Include all conjunctions and interjections as spoken. If a speaker finishes their thoughts with *or, so, but*, then offset them with a comma.

## Contractions

Transcribe all contractions as spoken except for *could've*, *should've*, and *would've*, which are transcribed as *could have*, *should have*, *would have*.

## Slang

Transcribe all informal words with their formal spelling, except for the following:

- Y'all.
- Ain't.
- Gotcha.
- Alls.
- I'ma.

*yep* or *yup* get corrected to *yes* or *yeah* respectively.

## Incorrect Grammar

Incorrect grammar is transcribed as spoken. We preserve what was said, we don't make it sound good.

## Unconventional Words

Nonstandard words should be included as spoken, using the most common are logical spelling you can find. If the word it made up, then spell it out as best you can.

## Crutch Words

Crutch words are utterances (usually associated with a verbal tic) that does not add meaning to what is said. In CVL, we keep all crutch *words*, punctuating them with commas as necessary. We omit hesitations are thinking sounds such as *uh*, *ah*, *um*, *er*, et cetera.

## False Starts

This is when a speaker stops mid-sentence and then begins again. We keep all false starts, which we mark with double dashes followed by a space before the next letter. The dashes are attached to the preceding word. Examples in page 10.

## Interruptions

When people are interrupted, use a double at the end of the line to indicate the interruption. Once the interruption has been resolved, start the next line of the interrupted speaker with a double dash. Do not capitalize the continued line. Attach the continuing dashes to the next letter.

## Nonverbal Responses

We only keep the three already discussed nonverbal responses in CVL: *uh-huh*, *uh-uh*, and *huh?*, for yes, no, and for not paying attention respectively.

We only keep *uh-huh* and *uh-uh* when they are the **sole response** to a question. Otherwise they are omitted.

## Feedback Words

These are generic words or phrases that are used for acknowledgment that the other speaker is listening. We transcribe all feedback words, even as interruptions. As above, nonverbal responses are only included if they are the sole response to a question.

## Titles and Ranks

Professional titles and military ranks should be written out when used without the owner's name. If used in direct address, then make sure to capitalize them, otherwise they should be lowercase. Generic titles such as sir, miss, ma'am should be lowercased unless they are the start of a sentence.

For a female person's name, use **only** Ms., no matter how it is spoken.

## Repeated Words

If the exact same word is repeated several times in a row unintentionally, we call that a repetition. We keep all full words, similar to stutters, and they are marked with a double dash, just like a false start.

Naturally, if the words are being repeated intentionally, then separate them by commas.

If a speaker repeats full sentences, keep all the sentences.

## Tags

Tags are always in lowercase letters and surrounded in square brackets. While these tags are useful, you should aim to use them as little as possible, particularly the [inaudible] tag.

### [inaudible]

We use [inaudible] in place of speech that you can't make out due to the speaker's accent, someone talking over them, poor audio quality, a noise obscuring the words, or a term you couldn't figure out while researching.

Our goal is to transcribe as such as possible, hence you should try and get as much of the problem area as possible before using the [inaudible] tag. It helps to go through the whole file a second time and revisiting all the [inaudible] tags to see if any of them are cleared up now that you've gotten used accent, context, et cetera.

You should punctuate the [inaudible] tag as if it were speech.

**Do not use [inaudible] if** :

- The audio cuts out entirely; Mark the last full word with a double dash and resume transcribing when speech resumes.
- If there is a gap in the audio and a speaker's line obviously begins in the middle of their speech. Capitalize the first clear word you can make out. Do **not** use double dashes to start this line.
- Avoid using [inaudible] if a speaker whispers or trails off into mumbles, or in scenarios where there is heavy crosstalk. In both these instances, a double dash is preferred.

## Numbers and Symbols

The most important thing is to convey what the speaker is saying in a suitable, readable format.

- Use words for zero through ten.
- Use numerals for numbers greater than ten: 11, 12, 13...
	-  You may use smaller numerals for the sake of consistency with larger numerals (i.e. 10 or 11 cookies, approximately 6 out of 14 candidates, et cetera).
- Use numerals for percentages, but spell out *percent* (no using %).
- Use numerals for money.
- Use a currency symbol *if it is said*, but only one of \$, £, €. ("455 dollars" $\to$ \$455, "22 bucks" $\to$ 22 bucks, et cetera.)
- Use ampersand & if it is the common formatting of a name (Dolce & Gabbana).
- Use words for any other symbols except for conventional formatting or for a trademarked name.

### Ranges and Series

For a range or series, spell out any common denominator, but follow the standard number rules for formatting the rest. We spell out *to* instead of using a hyphen. If there is no connecting word, use a comma.

Spell out symbols if they apply to multiple numbers in the immediate context.

If there are multiple numbers in the same sentence or paragraph, make sure to format them consistently. In particular, if numerals are used for one category and spelled numbers are used in a different category, make sure you stick with them. Good example in page 15 of the CV guide.

### Terms and Names

Transcribe common names according to their standard convention, even if it clashes with the guide provided here. Use resources to confirm the industry standard format for any terms you encounter. Examples in page 15 of the CV guide.

### Estimates and Large Numbers

If a speaker gives a rough estimate of a large number, spell it out in words. Any exact numbers follow the regular convention we already established. Numbers such as millions, billions, trillions, et cetera - are spelled out. The number part follows the rules. We use numerals for very specific large numbers.

### Dates

Use numerals for dates. Format dates spoken as numbers in MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY format, using zeroes as placeholders ("five, nine, eighty-two" $\to$ 05/09/82).

When only a month and year are said, there is no comma between them (May' 94, June 2000). Decades have no apostrophes before the s ('70s, '90s).

If spoken, use ordinals.

Finally, use a comma after day and year in full dates (May 8th, 2023, ...).

### Times

- Keep *o'clock* if said.
- Add a colon and zeroes if only the *hour* is said.
- Transcribe complex phrases as spoken.
- Transcribe full times with a colon (do not add a zero before the hour).
- Transcribe AM and PM as in all caps and no punctuation.
- Transcribe military time with numerals and *without* a colon.

### Measures of Time

Transcribe measures of time according to the standard number rules.

### Fractions

Fractions are spelled out. A whole number preceding the fraction follows the standard number rules. Fractions used for measurements may be written as numerals to comply with standard formatting convention.

### Always Numerals

The following things are always written as numerals:

- Human ages and heights (5 years old, 6' 33").
- Dates.
- Time.
- Addresses.
- Wards and districts.
- Decimals.
- Exhibit numbers.
- Measurements.
- Money.
- Percentages.
- Scales.
- Pages, paragraphs, lines, articles, subsections, chapters, parts, volumes, media, et cetera. (use numerals *even if the number is given as an ordinal*)
- Mathematical equations.
- Religious references.

## Punctuation

You must have a very good grasp of sentence structure and punctuation in order to be successful. This section is not a reference for English punctuation, but roar are rather helpful tips for specific situations.

### Run-on Sentences

Break up long-winded or run-on sentences whenever possible. You can start a new sentence with a conjunction, but don't make choppy sentences.

### Sentence Fragments

While you should try to break up long sentences, do not break them into incomplete ones. Punctuate according to standard English conventions. Proofread and punctuate without audio so as not to be influenced by the speakers' style of speech.

Do not join incomplete sentences with a semicolon.

### Single Dashes

You may use single dashes to offset information within a sentence when either a complete sentence or a list of items is inserted into the main sentence **if** the sentence outside the dashes is still a full sentence. Put a space before and after the dash.

If the additional information is neither a list or a complete sentence, use commas instead.

If the surrounding sentence would **not** be a cohesive sentence without the additional sentence removed, treat it as a false start.

#### Punctuation Between Single Dashes

For questions inside dashes, close the question before closing the dash. Use a semicolon instead of a period to separate two sentences in between single dashes.

### Colons and Semicolons

Use colons and semicolons sparingly in your transcriptions, under the following conditions:

- Use a colon when a complete sentence introduces a list.
- Use a colon when a complete sentence introduces another complete sentence or thought.
- Use a colon when a complete sentence introduces a question.
- Use a semicolon to join two closely related sentences without a conjunction.
- Use a semicolon to separate items in a complex list where the items contain internal commas. This makes it easier to distinguish each list item.
- Use a semicolon to join a complete sentence with a short, trailing, generic question prompting someone to give **simple confirmation** (yes or no questions.) These questions must be two words or more and **always** start with a verb. This is seen frequently with lawyers doing Q&A.

Do not use semicolons to tack on unique questions that seek more details than just yes or no.

### Commas

This section is for guidelines to prevent common comma errors.

- Use a comma before a conjunction connecting two complete sentences. You may omit this comma for sentences that are fewer than 10 words.
- Use the Oxford comma if list items are not being separated by conjunctions.
- Use a comma to offset a name or title used to address someone. Use two if the title is in the middle of the sentence.
- Use a comma (or two) to offset interjections and adverbs.
- Use a comma when a question ends with a single word prompting for confirmation from the other speaker.
- A comma splice refers to a comma that links two or more complete sentences without a conjunction between them. **Do not** use comma splices. Punctuate the sentences separately.
- Do not use a comma after a conjunction unless it is required for a dependent clause that follows.
-  Never separate subject from verb with a comma.
- Do not add commas just because a speaker has paused. Your commas should always follow standard English convention.

### Quotation Marks

Use quotation marks for direct and hypothetical speech, whether spoken, thought, or written. This is often a judgment call, so aim for readability.

Punctuate quotes using standard American English conventions. Capitalize the first word of the quote, and punctuate the quoted sentence inside the quotation marks.

If a sentence requires punctuation outside the quote rather than inside, then place it outside of the quote.

If there are nested quotes, use single quotes in side the double quotes. Don't forget to close both.

Use quotation marks if a word or phrase is quoted exactly from a document are another speaker. Don't use them for indirect quotes or for paraphrasing.

#### Interrupted Quotes

If a speaker interrupts their quote by inserting additional information before continuing, use commas or single dashes as per the above guidelines to offset the interruption. Do not capitalize the second part of the quote unless each part of of quote is a separate sentence, where we then start with a capital letter.

If another speaker interrupts the main speaker, use double dashes **inside** the quotation marks.

#### Media Titles

Titles of books, movies, et cetera are written as one normally sees titles, capitalizing important words as well as the first word. Do not use quotations are any other formatting for titles.

### Other Punctuation

#### Apostrophes

Use apostrophes as per standard English conventions. If a year is abbreviated, an apostrophe takes the place of the missing digits.

#### Hyphens

These are commonly used when multiple words combine to make a compound adjective. We hyphenate adjectives **only** when they precede the noun.

#### Spoken Punctuation

If a speaker dictates punctuation, punctuate as instructed, using standard punctuation throughout the text. Omit the spoken punctuation words. This is generally used in medical notes or when a document is being read aloud. Into the legal record.

#### Parenthesis and Ellipses

We do not use parenthesis are ellipses unless they are necessary for conventional formatting.

#### Accented Letters

We do not use special characters or accented letters.
