Recall Frobenius Theorem: For $L^{h}= \text{span} \set{X_{1}, ..., X_{h}}$ an $h-$dimensional distribution in an open set $U$, there exists a local coordinate system $L^{h}= \text{span}\set{\partial_{u^{1}}, ..., \partial_{u^{\alpha}}}$ if and only if $L^{h}$ obeys the Frobenius condition:

$$
\comm{X_{i}}{X_{j}} \equiv 0 \mod \set{X_{i}}.
$$

$L^{h}$ is part of the tangent space of a submanifold this is defined by $u^{\alpha}= 0$. $u^{\alpha}$ also equals 0 for $h + 1 \leq \alpha \leq n = \dim (M)$. This submanifold is what we call the integral (sub-)manifold of the distribution $L^{h}$.

## Picard's Theorem

Let $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}:(x, t)\mapsto f (x, t)$ be continuous and let $\pdv{f}{x}$ be continuous. Then for each $(x_{0}, t_{0})$ there is an open interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ containing $t_{0}$ and a unique function $x:I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, x (t_{0})= x_{0}$, obeying

$$
\dv{x}{t} = f (x, t).
$$

### With $1-$forms

On $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with coordinates $(x, t)$, let $\omega=-f (x, t)\dd{t}+ \dd{x}$. For some $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ an open interval about $t_{0}$, there exists a unique integral curve $C:I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $\ev{C' (t), \omega}= 0$ (in other words, $C^{*}\omega = 0$).

## Flow Box Theorem in Differential Forms

If $X$ is a smooth vector field then there are local coordinates $(\omega^{1}, ..., \omega^{n})$ such that $X = \pdv{\omega^{1}}$. The flow box lemma guarantees local coordinates as above. Then there are $n-1$ linearly independent $1-$forms $\set{\theta^{2}, ... ,\theta^{n}}$ such that $\ev{X, \theta^{\alpha}}= 0$. $\theta^{\alpha}$ are just linear combinations of $\dd{\omega^{\alpha}}$ for $2 \leq \alpha \leq n$.

# Annihilator of a Set of Forms

If $\set{\beta_{i}}$ is a set of forms of arbitrary degree at some $p \in M$, then there is a distribution $L$ of vectors such that, for any $X \in L$, $\beta (X)= 0$. The largest such set is called the annihilator of $\set{\beta_{i}}$.

The complete ideal of $\set{\beta_{i}}$ is the set of all forms of arbitrary degree whose restriction to $\set{\beta_{i}}$ vanishes.

A set of $1-$forms is said to generate the complete ideal of $\set{\beta_{i}}$ if the complete ideal of $\set{\alpha_{i}}$ is the same as the complete ideal of $\set{\beta_{i}}$.

- If $\alpha$ is in the complete ideal, then so is $\alpha \wedge \gamma$ for any form $\gamma$.
- Every complete idea can be generated by a set of $1-$forms.
- An ideal is a differential ideal in for every $\gamma$ in the ideal, $\dd{\gamma}$ is also in the ideal

> $$
\text{span}\set{\dd{z}, \dd{x}\wedge \dd{z}, \dd{y}\wedge \dd{z}, \dd{x}\wedge \dd{y}\wedge \dd{z}}.
>$$

It's important to know that the complete ideal of a set of forms may not necessarily be a differential ideal.

## Test for Differential Ideals

The complete ideal generated by $1-$forms $\theta_{1}, ..., \theta_{s}$ is a differential ideal if and only if

$$
\dd{\theta_{i}}\wedge \theta_{1}\wedge... \wedge \theta_{s}= 0
$$

for $1 \leq i \leq s$.

## Frobenius Theorem in Differential Forms

Let $M$ be a smooth $n-$manifold. $U$ a neighborhood of $p \in M$, and $\set{\omega_{1}, ..., \omega_{s}}$ be a set of smooth 1-form fields for $s < n$ that are linearly independent at $p$.

If $\exists$ $1-$form fields $\alpha_{i}^{j}$ with $1 \leq j \leq s$ such that

$$
\dd{\omega_{i}} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{s}\alpha_{i}^{j}\wedge \omega_{j}\; \forall \; 1 \leq i \leq s,
$$

then there is a maximal connected $(n-s)-$dim embedded submanifold $I:\Sigma \hookrightarrow M$ through $p$ such that

$$
I^{*}(\omega^{j}) = 0 \qc 1 \leq j \leq s.
$$

Alternate version: If the complete ideal $I$ generated by $\set{\omega_{1}, ..., \omega_{s}}$ is a differential ideal, then there is a maximal connected $(n-s)-$dim embedded submanifold $I:\Sigma \hookrightarrow M$ through $p$ which is an integral manifold of $I$. Shrinking $U$ if necessary, there exists coordinates $(y^{1}, ..., y^{n})$ about $p$such that $I$ is generated by $\set{\dd{y^{1}}, ..., \dd{y^{n-s}}}$.
