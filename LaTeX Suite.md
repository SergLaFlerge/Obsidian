This is for figuring out what snippets should be switched so as to not conflict with steno strokes :) 

$$
\begin{align}
\underbrace{ \abs{\overline{ \frac{7\psi^{2}}{14\pi^{4}}}} }_{ = \delta_{nm} }
\end{align}
$$

trying to reference $\eqref{eq1}$. it kinda works but maybe one day we'll have a proper way to do this

$$
\abs{\frac{\overline{A\cap{B}}}{AB}} = \abs{\frac{\bar{A}}{AB}\cap \frac{\bar{B}}{AB}}
$$

$$
\Le_{1}^{2} \sum\limits_{1}^{2}
$$

This is also for MathBooster now, let us see...

$$
\begin{align}
e^{i\pi} + 1 & = 0 \\[1em]
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi^{\ast}\cdot\Psi\dd{x} & = 1 \\[1em]
A^{'\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}\prescript{}{\nu}A^{\nu} & = \sum\limits_{\nu=t,x,y,z}\Lambda^{\mu}\prescript{}{\nu}A^{\nu}
\end{align}
$$

[[#^2a7e08|1.1]]. Looks like this'll work just fine, just have to make sure to reference the equations at some point. [[LaTeX Suite#^623b31]]
