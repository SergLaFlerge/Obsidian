# Intro

Remember you're lecture section A1.

Quizzes are posted during most weeks. Must be done outside of class. There is one attempt and they are timed.

Quizzes open Tuesdays at 8:00 am and close Thursdays at 8:00 pm.

Consider the modules as the textbook for this class. You may read them before or after class (*preferably before*.)

Slides are what we will go over during class, and there will be class activities, mostly related to making small programs. You can calls check the in-class activities but it is better to do them with the prof.

No lab sessions till the week of September 16-20.

Labs are made such that you *can* finish the lab assignment in one go. But you should at least finish half of it.

Abstraction is the key of this course. If you can explain your code without going into the details, you will have learned more than someone that can't.

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

# What is this course about?

See slides for curse overview

Computing science is the study of computation, which is the modeling, representation, manipulation, and transformation of information. We use computation for problem solving, which can be just about anything.

Computing science uses algorithms. An algorithm is simply a plan or recipe that is used to solve a problem.

Computing science does this by creating programs: A sequence of instructions that specify is how to perform a computation. It is the program that contains your algorithms and your data.

- Program
	- Algorithm
		- Data


## Modeling VS Representing

Modeling is the process of choosing the features of your data, and representation is how you are choosing to input these features.

## Computational Problem Solving VS Programming

Computational problem solving comes *before* programming. This is the part where you find an abstract computational solution for a problem or task.

Programming is about actually implementing this solution into a programming language.

You cannot program without first solving the problem abstractly.

### Key Skills

The only way to solving a big problem is to break the problem into smaller problems. These immediately will make the problem more manageable and you will be able to test different parts of the problem without needing the whole solution.

We must then find a way to represent the problem in a way that a computer can understand. To do this, we make an algorithm that takes the required data and instructions, and implement it using a programming language.
