# Race to Oblivion

We look at three points:

1. Early rocketry.
2. The German connection.
3. Race to oblivion.

The winner of the Cold War would be whoever would build the better rockets.

## Early Rocketry

The first rockets came from ancient China in the 13th century. While they were in fact used for military reasons, the main purpose was religious. Evil spirits were scared away by loud noises, and nothing made more noise than a solid fuel rocket. It is rumored that the Chinese were trying to go to the moon, but solid rocket fuel would never be enough.

In 1903, the same year as the Wright brothers had "achieved" flight, Konstantin Ciolkowski would write about the "Exploration of cosmic space by use of reaction devices." No one would be interested in rockets for a while yet, so had was mostly forgotten.

In 1919, Robert Goddard, obsessed with reaching the moon, wrote about space flight. We wrote a book, "method for reaching extreme altitudes" which would detail how to theorically reach the moon. The was not taken seriously, and was made a laughing stock of the science community.

In 1922, Hormann Oberth would fail to defend his PhD thesis, "by rocket to planetary travel," and would also fail to be taken seriously. It wasn't until had student, Werner von Braun.

## The German Connection

The first proposition for an intercontinental ballistic missile was known as the A10, designed in 1940. It was, however, destroyed by the allied forces. The A12 spacecraft was designed as a spacecraft, but mainly for the purposes of exploration. It would eventually evolve into the Saturn space rocket that would take the first people to the moon.

In 1942, Germany would make the A4 rocket, otherwise known as the V2 rocket. It would become the first man made object to reach space. This technology would be used for war, and it would start a new type of warfare, known as "push button warfare." The V2 rocket was unstoppable. It would go up at Mach 5 into space and come down at Mach 4. It would be undetectable and cause massive damage.

V2s and many other secret technologies would be made at Mittelwerk factory. It was nicknamed "Aladdin's cave", but what was the cost. The production process was deadly. It is said that every rocket made would cost six lives. Mittelwerk cave was made as a work camp for the Dora concentration camp. It was specifically made as a death camp where people would make rockets and die. It could be from starvation, injury, or straight up execution, but almost everyone would die.

von Braun would become head of NASA, which meant that his past would have to be destroyed. The pictures we are seeing in this presentation would have not been show-able even just a couple years ago.

The survivors of Dora, who were now behind the "iron curtain" tried to protest, but were never successful. von Braun felt no shame as far as we know. His famous quote goes "science does not have a moral dimension. I only build the rocket. Where they come down is not my domain." Quotes like these would be used by many Nazis, and even future scientists.

The Americans were not the only ones to get their hands on German tech and scientists. The USSR captured leftover V2 rockets and scientists from Mittelwerk, and would in fact beat the US during the early stages of the space race. They also treated their captured Germans very differently than the Americans. They would treat them as prisoners and essentially force them to work.

## Race to Oblivion

This was the race between East and West. In October 4th 1957, Sputnik 1 became the first man-made object sent to space. It was a huge hit to the American propaganda, specially because it was equipped with 50 kilograms of radio equipment, which broadcasted pro-communism messages. The size of the payload was significant, as that was the size of the bomb's payload that ended WWII. This meant Russia was capable of bringing nuclear weapons into space.

In 1958, NASA is established as a response to Russian advancements. In 1961, Vostok 1 brings the first human — Yuri Gargarin — to space. He tragically died, or most likely murdered.

In 1963, Valentina Tereshkova becomes the first woman in space. Again a major win for the Russians. They further dominate by sending Luna 9 to the moon, and successfully land it. That same year, the Russians send Venera 3 to Venus and becomes the first man-made object successfully sent to another planet. Finally, Zond 5 becomes the first object to orbit the mon and come back. With all these achievements, everything was now in place for sending humans to the moon.

In fact, despite all the Russian wins, it would be the Americans that would "win" the space race by becoming the first to send people to the moon, on July 20, 1969.

After this, public interest dropped significantly. This resulted in major budget cuts, which pushes the west to make shuttles, which would be reusable and therefore cheaper. The east saw this as a new weapon platform, as opposed to the west, where it was — at least publicly — seen as a peaceful endeavor.

Eastern space travel would continue with a lot of fervor until the collapse of the Soviet Union, after which there would be no government support. We can see how space travel depended greatly on external factors.
