# To Capture Motion

One of the questions that scientists were asking in the royal society of London was, "how do things move? (Horses in particular.)" By taking a series of photographs taken by cameras in single file, we got a sense of the motion of the horse. This would become the foundation of moving pictures.

In 1895, the Lumiere brothers bring the above idea to the public. Back then, these films would be seen in very small boxes through binoculars. The Lumiere brothers sought to bring the viewing experience to "the big screen" for the public to see.

By 1896, all technological components were in place to make long movies, and make movies to tell stories rather than simply depicting events. The person who invented cinema was Georges Melies. He was known as the "forgotten wizard who invented cinema." He saw film as a way to tell stories and bring happiness to people through this medium. He invented movies, science fiction movie, the first color movies, special effects, and film editing. He built the very first film studio. It made over 500 movies.

Naturally he would fail financially, thanks to Edison stealing his content, as well as failing to adapt to the times. His Studio would be demolished and his movies destroyed. He was forgotten until he was eventually rediscovered. His lack of financial success would be the reason he wouldn't be considered a great man.

By 1918, the only real industry that survived the great war: Hollywood. At the time, Hollywood would produce 98% of films. They took a completely different approach to film-making than Melies: They introduced the factory system to film making. As said by one of the main people behind this to say "film is not an art, it is an investment." There was no artistic independence, everything was controlled by the Studio owner/investors/banks. They would censor idea that would challenge the American way of life, or capitalism in general.

In response to this, Charlie Chaplin and Griffith would make an independent Studio, called United Artists in 1919. It was a place where artists could actually film. They were not desired in Hollywood as artists were too unpredictable to work in a place that was meant to have high standardization and predictability.

Charlie's films created the art form of expressionism, which went against the message of Hollywood. The invented social satire - critique of the "American dream", the factory system, and capitalism, for which he paid for very dearly. Hollywood told a narrative that was meant to reflect the American dream without ever showing the grim reality. Charlie was exiled from America on false charges of being Communist.

The takeover of industry by Hollywood brought the end of film as an art form. There were no longer independent artists. What we see is soulless repetitions of the same films and stories that avoided real-life social issues. Although Hollywood's code is different, the system has not changed. Film industry in 2020's is a "quested for predictable sails and profits." Before anything, a film must make money first.

We have endless replications/copying of films/ideas that made money in the past. They favor quantity over quality. The introduction of AI into the film industry will make this problem much, much worse. Now there won't even be any humanity. Prove thinks by 2026-2027 we will see much more AI in film, furthering the quantity over quality approach.

Photography/film were products of the industrial revolution. By 1900's, steam meets intentional combustion engines, and reaches its technological limit.
