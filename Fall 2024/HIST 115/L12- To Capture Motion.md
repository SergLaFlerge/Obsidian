# To Capture Motion

One of the questions that scientists were asking in the royal society of London was, "how do things move? (Horses in particular.)" By taking a series of photographs taken by cameras in single file, we got a sense of the motion of the horse. This would become the foundation of moving pictures.

In 1895, the Lumiere brothers bring the above idea to the public. Back then, these films would be seen in very small boxes through binoculars. The Lumiere brothers sought to bring the viewing experience to "the big screen" for the public to see.

By 1896, all technological components were in place to make long movies, and make movies to tell stories rather than simply depicting events. The person who invented cinema was Georges Melies. He was known as the "forgotten wizard who invented cinema." He saw film as a way to tell stories and bring happiness to people through this medium. He invented movies, science fiction movie, the first color movies, special effects, and film editing. He built the very first film studio. It made over 500 movies.

Naturally he would fail financially, thanks to Edison stealing his content, as well as failing to adapt to the times. His Studio would be demolished and his movies destroyed. He was forgotten until he was eventually rediscovered. His lack of financial success would be the reason he wouldn't be considered a great man.

By 1918, the only real industry that survived the great war: Hollywood. At the time, Hollywood would produce 98% of films. They took a completely different approach to film-making than Melies: They introduced the factory system to film making. As said by one of the main people behind this to say "film is not an art, it is an investment." There was no artistic independence, everything was controlled by the Studio owner/investors/banks. They would censor idea that would challenge the American way of life, or capitalism in general.

In reponse to this, Charlie Chaplin and Griffith would make and independent Studio.
