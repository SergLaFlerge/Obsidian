## Cars that Changed the World

In term with our relationship with the way we interact with technology, cars are very important. Why? Personal freedom — lifestyle — accessibility — memories — cheap — easy to learn.

You may not remember your first bicycle, but to will remember your first car. They had a special place in our culture. This is starting to change now.

### Combustion Engines

Joseph Lenoir invents the internal combustion engine, powered by coal-gas byproduct. He may not have been the first, but he was the first commercially successful. Funnily enough, it was meant to be used in a stationary fashion.

A man know as Nikolaus Otto had the idea to copy Joseph's engine and modify it to obtain a separate patent and get rich. In 1876, he hires two assistants to create the very first 4 stroke stationary engine, after which Otto fired them. That forced the ex-assistants to create their own.

In 1885, Karl Benz creates the first "automobile powered by gas." This was the first commercially available vehicle, known as the Benz Motorwagen. The engine was 958cc with a maximum 0.8 hp. It was not successful ultimately.

The two assistants that Otto fired would be Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. They made a company named Daimler co. In the same year as Karl, they create the "grandfather's clock engine." It was the first modern gasoline engine of 100 cc and produced around 1hp, which was a huge difference to Karl's engine. They installed their engine into a frame, and so they made the first motorcycle. Story goes that Maybach tried it, lit his pants on fire, and decided that there was no future in motorcycles. One year later, in 1886, the make the first true car. True in the sense that it looked the most car-like. In 1894, they create the Phoenix engine, which was a 4 cylinder engine. It caused a revolution it still had no carburetor, but it was still highly successful. Their car would essentially become the model from which every car would be built.

In 1990, Emil Jellinek asks them to make a racecar that would be commercially available. It would become known as the Mercedes, after Emil's daughter. This was the PWEUFRT of the modern car. It had a carburetor, electric spark plug, and the atomizer from Heron of Alexandria himself. Adding this to the carburetor made it much more fuel-efficient and powerful. While commercially available, it was not mass produced.

In 1901, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash becomes the first mass produced car, made on the assembly line. Henry Ford did not invent the assembly line nor the first car. Some people argued that electric vehicles were the more efficient choice, and this is something that is coming back to us again now. Electric vehicles became popular, and even back then there were over 50000 charging stations. So why did we not stick with electric vehicles? There are both internal and external reasons.

Internally, there simply was no way to increase the range in the cars as efficiently, while gas powered cars were able to make these trips. However, the real reason was external: advertisement. Electric vehicle were catered exclusively towards women. They were also priced higher than their gas counterparts in order to keep lower classes from buying them.

They made the norm that gentlemen driving electric cars was not manly.

In 1908, Henry Ford creates the Ford Model T. It was the first real car to be available for the lower classes. It sold over 16 million units and they made a killing.

During the roaring 20's people had way too much money, and so they spend it on cars. Cars become a huge part of the culture, and it was a symbol of the state of the world at the time. Car designs would once again change during The Great Depression. There was no money no more, and so all these highly luxurious cars would be solid for pennies on the dollar. It is in the 30's that we see the development of cheap, "people's car" that were easy to work on and were meant to last forever. In 1938, the Volkswagen Beetle would enter the scene. It would become the longest/most produced car in the world.

From 1934-1957, we get the Citroen Traction Avant, the first uni-body front-wheel-drive car.

In 1940, we get the first 4 by 4 cars by Jeep.

1950-1959 is the golden bays of cars and rock and roll. This is the time where cars become embedded into our culture. Many of the designs were influenced by the "jet age" and so we get many cars with jet inspired designs. Profs fave is the 1951 GM LeSabre (F-86 Sabre jet).

In 1969, we get the Range Rover, which marked the birth of the SUV. It was a vehicle that had off-road capabilities, but could be used as a regular car in the city as well.

In the 1970's, we get the American "gas guzzlers" and box cars. This was fine because gas at the time was cheap and practically unlimited. This wouldn't last, however, as the oil crisis would hit from 1973-1979. The US, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan would all run out of gasoline. The US supplied weapon to Israel, which the Arab countries responded by placing embargos.

This is shortage caused car designs to become super compact and fuel efficient. The first European model was the Fiat model 126.

In 1983, Dodge makes the dodge Caravan, and sets the paradigm of the modern Minivan. They would mostly be phased out by SUVs, but still have their uses even today.

Around the 80's and 90's, Japan would explode in popularity, due to their cars being small but very powerful. As powerful as the gas guzzlers of the previous era.

## Cars of the Future

What will be the future of the car industry? Specially with the talk of switching to electric. Many companies have started making hybrid models, that take the best of both, for the most part.

One of the first alternate sources of fuel was nuclear powered cars. The 1962 Ford XXI was such example. This obviously had many problems, mainly the radioactivity and size of the reactors. It was very hard to transmit the nuclear power to mechanical power, so that was the final straw.

The government also had the fear of giving the common person a nuclear reactor, particularly in the case of some commies grabbing it and using it for the wrong reasons.

The car that started the modern resurgence of the electric vehicle was the 1997 Honda EV. It was a commercial failure. One of the reasons was purely aesthetic, as it was very ugly. It was ludicrously expensive, and you didn't technically own it.

Yet another possibility was using hydrogen fuel cells. It has some advantages, but the main problem is the sheer weight. Converting hydrogen to mechanical power takes lots of equipment, and worst of all, the hydrogen is super compressed, making it *highly* explosive. HFCs may have a use in trains and such, but not the everyday car. There is also not that much hydrogen in the earth, so where will we get the necessary amount? With that, there is also no real infrastructure for it.

Will electric cars have the same impact on our culture as other cars? Prof thinks probably not. He thinks we will treat them just as we have in the past: Just a tool to get from A to B. Regular cars give the common person the freedom to go anywhere and interact multiple levels. Electric cars now have many ways to track your data, which can then be sold to companies. Electric vehicles are also highly limited and hard to work on/fix.

The EV fad is designed to be a controlled transportation system, with 100% disposable products that are designed to fail.

All these factors contribute to the lack of attachment.

He also thinks they're ugly as fuck, which is fair and true.

These cars are also advertised as "clean", but really, the materials needed cause a huge environmental impact, and these resources are highly limited and non-renewable.

Prof thinks we will go back to nuclear energy.

The internal combustion engine was a part of the puzzle for another industry, planes.
