## Cars that Changed the World

In term with our relationship with the way we interact with technology, cars are very important. Why? Personal freedom — lifestyle — accessibility — memories — cheap — easy to learn.

You may not remember your first bicycle, but to will remember your first car. They had a special place in our culture. This is starting to change now.

### Combustion Engines

Joseph Lenoir invents the internal combustion engine, powered by coal-gas byproduct. He may not have been the first, but he was the first commercially successful. Funnily enough, it was meant to be used in a stationary fashion.

A man know as Nikolaus Otto had the idea to copy Joseph's engine and modify it to obtain a separate patent and get rich. In 1876, he hires two assistants to create the very first 4 stroke stationary engine, after which Otto fired them. That forced the ex-assistants to create their own.

In 1885, Karl Benz creates the first "automobile powered by gas." This was the first commercially available vehicle, known as the Benz Motorwagen. The engine was 958cc with a maximum 0.8 hp. It was not successful ultimately.

The two assistants that Otto fired would be Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. They made a company named Daimler co. In the same year as Karl, they create the "grandfather's clock engine." It was the first modern gasoline engine of 100 cc and produced around 1hp, which was a huge difference to Karl's engine. They installed their engine into a frame, and so they made the first motorcycle. Story goes that Maybach tried it, lit his pants on fire, and decided that there was no future in motorcycles. One year later, in 1886, the make the first true car. True in the sense that it looked the most car-like. In 1894, they create the Phoenix engine, which was a 4 cylinder engine. It caused a revolution it still had no carburetor, but it was still highly successful. Their car would essentially become the model from which every car would be built.

In 1990, Emil Jellinek asks them to make a racecar that would be commercially available. It would become known as the Mercedes, after Emil's daughter. This was the PWEUFRT of the modern car. It had a carburetor, electric spark plug, and the atomizer from Heron of Alexandria himself. Adding this to the carburetor made it much more fuel-efficient and powerful. While commercially available, it was not mass produced.

In 1901, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash becomes the first mass produced car, made on the assembly line. Henry Ford did not invent the assembly line nor the first car. Some people argued that electric vehicles were the more efficient choice, and this is something that is coming back to us again now. Electric vehicles became popular, and even back then there were over 50000 charging stations. So why did we not stick with electric vehicles? There are both internal and external reasons.

Internally, there simply was no way to increase the range in the cars as efficiently, while gas powered cars were able to make these trips. However, the real reason was external: advertisement. Electric vehicle were catered exclusively towards women. They were also priced higher than their gas counterparts in order to keep lower classes from buying them.

They made the norm that gentlemen driving electric cars was not manly.

In 1908, Henry Ford creates the Ford Model T. It was the first real car to be available for the lower classes. It sold over 16 million units and they made a killing.

During the roaring 20's people had way too much money, and so they spend it on cars. Cars become a huge part of the culture, and it was a symbol of the state of the world at the time. Car designs would once again change during The Great Depression. There was no money no more, and so all these highly luxurious cars would be solid for pennies on the dollar. It is in the 30's that we see the development of cheap, "people's car" that were easy to work on and were meant to last forever. In 1938, the Volkswagen Beetle would enter the scene. It would become the longest/most produced car in the world.

From 1934-1957, we get the Citroen Traction Avant, the first uni-body front-wheel-drive car.

In 1940, we get the first 4 by 4 cars by Jeep.

1950-1959 is the golden bays of cars and rock and roll. This is the time where cars become embedded into our culture. Many of the designs were influenced by the "jet age" and so we get many cars with jet inspired designs. Profs fave is the 1951 GM LeSabre (F-86 Sabre jet)
