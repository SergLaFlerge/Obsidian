# Development of Photography

The first person to put photography and the camera together was Joseph Niepce. He was a French inventor. He was looking into ways to put bitumen, a waste product. To use.

He found that mixing bitumen with turpentine, he got a substance that was light-sensitive. In 1826, he places his mixture into a tin plate and calls it Heliography. It was not duplicable. In 1827, he heads to London and gives his photo the Royal Society. It goes nowhere, so he gets discouraged.

He partners with French artist Louis Daguerre and eventually dies. Daguerre would then be regarded as the inventor of photography. As Niepce died, Daguerre's first picture from 1839 is regarded as the first photo taken with a camera. It was the same mechanism as the first one, so it was still not duplicable.

In 1851 a sculptor by the name as Frederick something-something invents a new method of plates that could be duplicated known as the collodion process. These plates where "ready to use" and did not require photographers to carry all these chemicals.

The collodion made a negative image, and this would then be printed into the albumen as a positive. It had excellent tonal range. One of the great advantages was that it was very light sensitive, so one was able to take photos in the dark.

Andre Disderi would would make the concept of the carte-de-visite in 1854. It was in albumen print on cardboard. It was extremely popular, and is likely what you're familiar with.

# Photography- content, context, and approaches

We will focus on six approaches:

1. Portraiture- indoors-light-exposure time. As one usually had only one chance to take a picture, people had to make it count, so photographers made sure to capture as much character out of the people they photographed.
2. Composite photography. Here, the photographer would control the narrative. Ghosts were quite popular to do, as well as it trying to tell stories through the photographs.
3. Naturalists. This was the polar opposite to composite photography. The idea was to instead take photos as they were rather than staging the photo. However it was a bit hypocritical, since almost every naturalist photo is staged to some extent.
4. Documentation of events-photojournalism. The industrial revolution is a great example as the first recorded period in history that was recorded through photographs. We also start seeing the working class appearing in the backgrounds of these photos.
5. Social photography. Here we start seeing the working class front and center. These photographs were used to support the working class, and show the owners that all people were equal, and differed only in social class.
6. Instant photography. This was a "return" to the search for objectivity. Basically candid pics. It was not very popular.

## Is there Objectivity in Photography?

Pretty much no. Just about every single photograph is staged to some extent.

# Cameras

The concept of a camera predates photography by about 1000 years. It was composed of a wooden box, lens, and a reflecting mirror. The lens would capture the image is that was then reflected into a dark room. The main use was for artists to essentially cheat by placing a blank canvas in front of the mirror and painting over the image.

Around 1855, we get the first Collodion dry plate cameras. They were fairly small, and because the "film" was light sensitive, we start seeing more outdoor photography. In 1900, George Eastman would make the first 118mm roll-film camera, named Kodak. It could take about 100 photos, and it was plug and play; no need to be and expert. This was also super cheap. As such, photography becomes a very popular activity. This camera would completely remove the photographer from the is developing process. People would simply mail their cameras to the Kodak factory where the images would be developed. They would then ship it back to you, reloaded and with both your pictures and the negatives. In 1914, the 35 mm cameras enter the picture and becomes the standard until 2008. In 1975, Kodak makes the first digital camera, but they were not commercially available.

In 1986, Kodak makes the first megapixel camera, powered by a microprocessor, but they would be extremely expensive. The first mostly accessible camera was made in 1995, and arguably it was the first successful digital camera.

A trunk was discovered in London, property of the royal society of London. In here, we find the very first picture by Joseph Niepce.

## Side-effects of Photography- Motion Pictures

Although movies with a side effect of photography, the initial use for "moving pictures" was for scientific purposes.
