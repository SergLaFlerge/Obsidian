# Development of Photography

The first person to put photography and the camera together was Joseph Niepce. He was a French inventor. He was looking into ways to put bitumen, a waste product. To use.

He found that mixing bitumen with turpentine, he got a substance that was light-sensitive. In 1826, he places his mixture into a tin plate and calls it Heliography. It was not duplicable. In 1827, he heads to London and gives his photo the Royal Society. It goes nowhere, so he gets discouraged.

He partners with French artist Louis Daguerre and eventually dies. Daguerre would then be regarded as the inventor of photography. As Niepce died, Daguerre's first picture from 1839 is regarded as the first photo taken with a camera. It was the same mechanism as the first one, so it was still not duplicable.

In 1851 a sculptor by the name as Frederick something-something invents a new method of plates that could be duplicated known as the collodion process. These plates where "ready to use" and did not require photographers to carry all these chemicals.

The collodion made a negative image, and this would then be printed into the albumen as a positive. It had excellent tonal range. One of the great advantages was that it was very light sensitive, so one was able to take photos in the dark.

Andre Disderi would would make the concept of the carte-de-visite in 1854. It was in albumen print on cardboard. It was extremely popular, and is likely what you're familiar with.

# Photography- content, context, and approaches

We will focus on six approaches:

1. Portraiture- indoors-light-exposure time.
2.
