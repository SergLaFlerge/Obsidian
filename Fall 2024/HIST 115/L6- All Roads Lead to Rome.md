# All Roads Lead to Rome

## Engineers and Standardization

Engineers were part of the military, and each legion would have a separate engineering unit who was there only to build things for the campaigns. They would build things such as forts, roads, etc. Romans were some of the first to use engineering projects as a form of social control. Prof has never seen roads as bad as here in Edmonton, so he thinks it's inspired by the Romans as a social control tool. LOL.

All the things the Romans built would have a high degree of standardization. Roman roads were built by armies, not slaves, which makes sense as there was little conflict overall. By building roads, the army was kept paid and busy. Their roads were very labor intensive as well.

The Greeks used columns, but the Romans invented something better: Arches. With their high standardization, these arches were made to last thousands of years, all the way to today. From this we see the first domes as well.

Rome was not built out of marble, which was only used as siding. Instead, the Romans used out of one of their best inventions: Cement. While cement had existed before, it was never to this scale. And their cement was better due to the use of volcanic ash instead of sand. The city of Rome was the first city to be built out of cement.

Rome would be the first city on earth to have a population over one million, and so they started to run into modern problems we have today. They solved these problems using technology.

How do you deliver fresh water to so many people? Aqueducts. Within the city, they would carry their water using lead pipes. They would have public and private toilets which we would not see for 2000 years. With it, they invented the underground sewage system, known as the *Cloaca Maxima*. We still use a similar system today, with much better technology of course.

Romans would build public structures to convey propaganda. Rome was the exact opposite to Egypt in this sense. Pretty much everything was made *for* the public. Anything you built belonged to the people of Rome, not to you. In exchange, you would get your name attached to it. This would basically give you advertisement to you and your family. This was important since Rome was all about familiar prestige.

One of the best examples is the Flavian theater (misnamed the Colosseum). It was built by the Flavia family. It was built for one single purpose... Sending a message.

The theatre was built on a lake, specifically a lake belonging to the house of Nero. He wasn't liked and was made to kill himself. Nero took the lake and made it his private lake, which was a big no-no. As such, the Flavian family built the theater on top of the lake as a message to the people that they were better than Nero by giving it back to Rome.

This is a good example to the Romans using technology to convey a message.

The theater would be further used for more social control. On days where games were played, people would be off work and food would be provided with entertainment. This keeps people happy. Taking one of these away would make people upset. This wouldn't last very long, only about 100 years, and Rome would eventually fall. The east would be conquered by Chinese technology and would prevail to the 1400's.
