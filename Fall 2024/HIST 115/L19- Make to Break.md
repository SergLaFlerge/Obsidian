# Make to Break â€” Consumerism and The Modern Society.

We look at two points:

1. Life of a lightbulb.
2. What can we learn from the indigenous peoples?

## Life of a Lightbulb

The lightbulb was the start of planned obsolescence.

In 1895, Adolphe Chaillet invented something quite amazing: The everlasting lightbulb. It had a lifetime of over 1 million hours (120 hours of continuous use). He failed miserably, and is a good point against technological determinism. It failed due to external reasons. It was basically a real life conspiracy theory. In 1924, the Phoebus cartel was created. It was the first *global* conspiracy of large companies to manipulate the market. It had two goals: To limit the life of lightbulbs globally to 1000 hours, and to stop inventors/companies proposing better lightbulbs. Even LEDs, which can theoretically last forever, have been manufactured to fail in other components.

This is important because it was only the start. Pretty much every business model in the world follows this idea of planned obsolescence. Everything you purchase is purposefully designed to fail. Even software is being designed to fail. The result is the complete and total collapse of sustainable goods. This also brings about great environmental destruction.

The real prop with many environmental movements is that the solution is not technological in nature, but *social*. In 2020's, your entire worldview and existence is based on consumerism and money. We can protest against the "global warming" but can't criticize the system/consumerism. Planned obsolescence is seen as a conspiracy theory.

But, there are entire economic models and goals set for engineers, which is to design things to *fail*. What if our growth/economy/business theories are wrong?

## What Can We Learn From Indigenous Peoples

The solution to our technological problems already exist. Many indigenous cultures believe in taking only the minimum and wasting nothing. They believe in working for a collective good of the *small* community. They are respectful of nature and their surroundings. Finally,, setting boundaries for the use of technology (as to not extinguish/overuse natural resources.) technological development must be controlled, as we will inevitably reach a point where we will take more than what we get back.

All these idea is led to the anti-growth model: Reduce consumption, reduce waste, reduce ecological footprint, and design things to last. To make this change, we would have to reject consumerism/planned obsolescence and associated value and economic systems, which is impossible in the 2020's, thanks mostly due to the sheer difference in population, as well as the increase in technology and scientism.
