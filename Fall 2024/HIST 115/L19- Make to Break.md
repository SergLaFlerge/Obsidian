# Make to Break â€” Consumerism and The Modern Society.

We look at two points:

1. Life of a lightbulb.
2. What can we learn from the indigenous peoples?

## Life of a Lightbulb

The lightbulb was the start of planned obsolescence.

In 1895, Adolphe Chaillet invented something quite amazing: The everlasting lightbulb. It had a lifetime of over 1 million hours (120 hours of continuous use). He failed miserably, and is a good point against technological determinism. It failed due to external reasons. It was basically a real life conspiracy theory. In 1924, the Phoebus cartel was created. It was the first *global* conspiracy of large companies to manipulate the market. It had two goals: To limit the life of lightbulbs globally to 1000 hours, and to stop inventors/companies proposing better lightbulbs. Even LEDs, which can theoretically last forever, have been manufactured to fail in other components.

This is important because it was only the start. Pretty much every business model in the world follows this idea of planned obsolescence. Everything you purchase is purposefully designed to fail. Even software is being designed to fail. The result is the complete and total collapse of sustainable goods. This also brings about great environmental destruction.
