# The Ways of Knowing

Two major points:
1. What is technology?
2. From technological to social determinism.

## 1.

To most people, technology is made up of objects, like cars and phones and such. But to historians, it is something else entirely: rather, technology is a *system*. All the objects we mentioned are products of the technology system. Technology is a system which leads to creation of predetermined products which is use in large scale with a high degree of standardization.

The textbook says technology is a system we use to solve real world problems, but prof disagrees. We now use technology to solve problems created by other technology. Interesting point for sure, we will come back to this later.

The system itself is not visible. We can define the products it produces, but the system is not visible. We call these silent, or invisible technologies. The common person may not think of these at all, but they are often the most important.

There are three major technologies that affect us all the time:

1. Education.
2.  Government.
3. Economy.

 These technologies completely shape our way of thinking, and these are not well recognized. They are key examples of invisible technologies.

## 2.

There are many approaches to the study of technology, but we will focus on three.

### How do we Know What we Know?

Wherever it comes from, our knowledge comes from interpretation of the past. Naturally this introduces bias coming from the approach, this scholar's background, etc. once again we focus on three approaches to Historiography:

1. Internal approach/great men/unidirectional model of technological determinism/evolutionary model.
2. External approach/social approach/social determinism.
3. Interactive view of technology in society.

Each one has its advantages and disadvantages.

#### Internal

Internalists usually come from a different background, with a more scientific background rather than historical. It is a very "nuts and bolts", often ignoring the societal impact of these technologies.

The problem is that these discoveries without being influenced by social (external) factors.

Without external factors, where do these people get their ideas? In comes the Great Men Theory, where these geniuses are simply born without societal influence. Independent inventors just "come up" with these inventions.

It is the dominant and most popular approach in mainstream media.

A big problem with this approach is that many of these great men didn't even invent the technologies they are credited with. Yet this is what we're taught.

Another problem is that they're all (white) men (hence great *men*.) there is often little to no mention of non-white and non-male inventors, which is a product of Westernization of history.

These people all became very rich, while the real inventors disappeared and ended up poor.

It's very convenient for the American dream for these lone geniuses to invent all these great things by themselves and then become extremely wealthy.

##### Unidirectional Model

Basically, we have a one-way relationship with technology, where it has a positive impact on society.

Technology shapes/influences society, but not the other way around. And example by Lynn White is horse stirrups. Knights appeared c. 1066 thanks to the horse stirrups. This is widely criticized, but prof argues that there is some merit, since it is difficult to deny as the change in society after the stirrups were invented was quite major.

##### Technological Determinism

Posits that technology is the most decisive factor behind change/development in history. The level of technological development is the only true measure of success of any society. Prof disagrees, since there are always many factors, and these days technology seems to cause more problems than solutions.



##### Evolutionary Model/Progressivism

Technology always evolves from "primitive" to complex "better" technologies. It certainly isn't true, but it has its moments. A good example from Thomas Hughes is that "technology emerged from a divine spark..." The human build world based an technology is like "paradise" (i.e. only positive)

But this comes from a very biased American view, which is not even true in America.

#### External

The next approach takes into account the impact society has in the development of technology. Society shapes/influences technology, standing in direct opposition to the internal approach.

There are no inborn geniuses or independent ideas, as everything is influenced by society. Prof disagrees, after all we have many examples in science where you can trace an idea to a point where it can't be traced further.

Failure are success of technology is determined by the external social factors, such as religion, social beliefs and norms, etc.

So how come religion is not an invisible technology? It can be argued both ways, but in this course will consider it as an external factor.

The downside is the idea of social determinism — all technological change is socially determined, not technologically. Society is *always* in control of technology.

In 2004, we said that new technologies will *never* run our lives. This is clearly untrue in our world.

#### Interactive

The more modern approach. This was a middle ground between the previous two approaches. It stipulates that technology is influenced/shaped by society and society is influenced/shaped by technology. Essentially, we have a two-way relationship with society and technology. This is the dominant trend today in academia.

## So What is the Correct Approach?

Well, it depends. They all have something tangible, so in this class we will use all three in combination, switching as we go to the more suitable approach and knowing why the others are not appropriate, or even fail, in certain situations.

To historians, technology is a ==system.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-26,13,270-->

There are many technologies that are not visible to us, we call these ==silent technologies.==
<!--SR:!2024-10-03,15,250-->

There are three major technologies that affect us all the time: :: Education, government, and economy.
<!--SR:!2024-10-07,18,250-->

The three major approaches to the study of technology we will focus on are: :: Internal, external, and interactive.

The internal approach is very nuts and bolts, often ==ignoring== the societal impact of these technologies.
<!--SR:!2024-10-24,30,270-->

 In the internal model, discoveries are made without ==being influenced by social factors.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-29,12,230-->

Without external factors, only natural-born geniuses come up with new ideas. This is known as the ==great men theory.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-25,12,270-->

T/F: The internal approach is the most popular in mainstream media: ::True.
<!--SR:!2024-09-26,13,270-->

One of the biggest problems with the internal approach is that the Great Men ==didn't really== invent the technologies they're credited with.
<!--SR:!2024-10-08,14,250-->

Another problem with the internal model is that these great men are ==all white and male.==
<!--SR:!2024-10-07,18,250-->

In the internal approach, we have a unidirectional model, where ==we have a one-way, always-positive relationship with technology.==
<!--SR:!2024-10-14,23,250-->

T/F: In internal model, technology shapes/influences society, and society also shapes and influences technology: ::False.
<!--SR:!2024-10-21,27,270-->

Technological determinism posits that ==technology is the most decisive factor behind change and development.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-30,6,150-->

The evolutionary model states that ==technology always evolves from  "primitive" to "better", more complex technologies.==
<!--SR:!2024-10-11,20,250-->

The external approach takes into account the impact ==society== has in the development of technology.
<!--SR:!2024-09-25,12,270-->

T/F: The external approach stands in direct opposition to the internal approach. ::True
<!--SR:!2024-10-21,27,270-->

In the external model there are no in-born geniuses or independent ideas, as everything is influenced by ==society.== There are examples where this isn't true, however.
<!--SR:!2024-09-26,13,270-->

Failure and success of technology in the external model is determined by ==external social factors.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-25,8,210-->

Social factors affecting the success of technology in the external approach include: :: Religion, social beliefs and norms, and others.
<!--SR:!2024-09-28,11,230-->

The downside of the external approach is the idea of social determinism —:: All technological change is socially determined.
<!--SR:!2024-09-27,9,190-->

In the external approach, society is ==always== in control of technology.
<!--SR:!2024-10-24,30,270-->

The interactive approach is a more ==modern== approach.
<!--SR:!2024-09-30,6,250-->

The interactive approach stipulates that ==technology and society influence each other.==
<!--SR:!2024-09-29,8,230-->

In the interactive approach, we have a ==two-way== relationship with society and technology.
