# The Day We Stopped Looking Up

We cover both the point in the title, but also external factors and the watch industry.

## Time

We don't really know when we started measuring time, but around 3500 BC we start seeing sundials and water clocks in Mesopotamia. Water clocks worked by filling a special cup with a small hole at the bottom with water. By filling the cup with different volumes, one would get different times. Sundials are self-explanatory.

Around 500 AD in China, we start seeing the candle clock. This was a major upgrade, as it would function as an alarm, and would function at night and, more importantly, indoors.

Around 1300 AD, we start seeing sand clocks in Europe. They were very expensive and would not see much use since mechanical clocks would have been introduced around this time as well. Sand clocks were accurate for short periods of time, but would get progressively worse as more time needed to be kept track of.

Two of the big external factors that expedited the need for new technology were religion and climate change.

Monks needed to pray at certain hours, lest they sin by missing these prayers. Candle clocks were not reliable, and so the church needed something better. Water clocks were even worse. They had no alarm system, and worse still, there was drastic climate change around this time, making it too cold to use water clocks effectively.

As a response to this need by the church, monk Richard of Wallingford eventually invents the first European mechanical clock. It is widely believed that his invention was inspired by Archimedes and the Islamic translations of his texts.

The clock used something called an escapement mechanism. Ancient clocks used water, but this one used weights and rope instead.

This is a fundamental change our relationship with nature. From now on, we would lose connection with nature/natural world. Machines would dictate time and run our lives.

This technology is the one that started the separation of man from nature. It would even change the way people thought about the world and the cosmos. The universe and our world would be seen as machines, and God, the supreme watch-maker.

Honorable mention: Astrarium by Giovanni de'Dondi. This was the first mechanical computer in Europe. It was invented in 1364, and functioned as a planetarium of sorts. The cosmos represented as a machine, but there was one missing component: God. There was no God inside the Astrarium. This is what would get Galileo into trouble. The idea that the cosmos could be described in purely mathematical and mechanical terms led to the mechanical philosophy. Scientists would start to no longer believe that god existed, which would undermine the church.

Most early clocks were not super accurate — within 20 or so minutes — but this would change over time. Thanks in part to the navy. c. 1770, John Harrison would invent the most accurate mechanical watch, and it would remain so until 1974. This clock would help take more accurate measurements and help advance science.

## External Factors and the Watch Industry

Britain held a monopoly in accurate watches. They had the best of the best. People from around the world would travel to Britain to put them to the test. This was true until the Swiss started to mass produce inexpensive, accurate watches. They were as accurate as the British but much, much cheaper. Between 1903 and 1968, 80% of watches in the world were made by the Swiss, and they would win the British time trials. The Swiss would dominate the market till then, but in 1968, Japan would enter the scene.

Seiko from Japan would make the first quartz watch, which was 10 times more accurate than anything at the time. They would be laughed at because they looked ugly, but they missed the point, and so Japan would win the watch race with their superior technology within one year.

# Why is it Important?

Mechanical clocks would lead to mechanical philosophy, which pretty much led to Newtonian physics. This is up there with the plow and the printing press in terms of human impact.
