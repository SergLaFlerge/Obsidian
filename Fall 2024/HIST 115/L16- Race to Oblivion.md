# Technology, Warfare, and The Cost of Progress

Four points covered:

1. Why Germany?
2. The human cost of technological progress.
3. Tanks.
4. Secret technologies and weapons.

## Why Germany?

*In 30 years, we went from the final model from the Wright brothers, to the very first picture of earth taken from space*

So why? There one thing the Germans had that no one else had: They were the first to use a new form of technological research, known as *technoscience*

The concept of technoscience is to integrate science, technology, the government, universities, and researchers. In particular to destroy and control, rather than problem solving and coping with the environment. It represented a fundamental shift that had three purposes: Killing mass amounts of people, destroying the environment, and making lots of money.

Perhaps the most horrific inventions was *atomic energy*. The Germans had split the atom and gotten energy out of it. Germany in general had better technology than all other countries. In 1943, Germany had the Z3, capable of storing up to 60 words. A year later, the Z4 would be the first commercially available computer.

Nazi television was also superior, as they had the best cameras around. They had the most advanced radio controlled devices at the time, and would be unchallenged until the 1950s.

One piece that is often forgotten is the 1935 Magnetophon K1. It was the first audio recorder that could record audio without distortion.

Germany also had the first guided missiles (V1), and the German jet engine would be the one that would prove superior. We would end up using their rocketry for space travel.

They pioneered modern design, which is still in use today. The most important thing to come out of Germany in the scope of this lecture is the invention of new warfare. They would create new methods to kill mass amounts of people.

## The Human Cost of Technological Progress

Before 1914, casualties sat between 60000 to maximum 200000. During the Great War of 1914, we finally start seeing professional engineers and scientists entering warfare. This resulted into over 10000000 casualties. Warfare had not yet changed however, as the philosophy was the same as before: Destroy the opponent's army. In 1939, we see the real shift in warfare philosophy. We go from fighting armies to the murder of civilians by the use of scientific theory/technology. The Germans adopted this philosophy from something known as Trenchard's Doctrine (which was British, not German): Destroying cities and killing civilians is much cheaper than fighting another army.

There were two branches of science that had started appearing around this time. The first one was social Darwinism — biological theory that became social/racial theory essentially, the weak disappear and the strong prevail. It would also become popular in America, as it was a great reflection of capitalism.

From social Darwinism came a second theory: Eugenics. It entails "improving" the human race by eliminating the weak and unwanted. Canada would be the last to hold on to this idea. IQ tests were born out of this theory.

While none of these ideas were German in origin, it would be Germany that would put them together. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute became the first institution to use technoscience.

While the killing of civilians had existed for a very long time. This would be the first time in human history where we would see the application of scientific theory and technology to enact mass murder. From this new science, Jews, Poles, and Slavs were inferior and thus should be exterminated. By taking their humanity, you make it easier to do violence to them.

Poland would be Germany's testing ground for their new approach to warfare. Its capital — Warsaw — was razed to the ground, and it would completely disappear. 30% of civilian population was exterminated in concentration camps. This was different from other camps, in the sense that they were really just extermination camps. It would be in Poland where they experimented with gruesome ways to mass-kill civilians.

Their extermination camps was factory system of mass murder and human disassembly. The West had a role to play in all this.

### Holocaust and the Role of the West

The West let the Germans do their experiments in Poland. Poland made a whole report detailing to the west the terrible things that were being done, with locations and pictures, and the West said that it was not in their best interest to intervene. All of these nation benefited from the Holocaust in one way or another.

In exchange for Nazi technologies, the US, Canada, and Britain gave Nazi war criminals protection.

## Tanks

Heinz Guderian convinced Hitler that tanks — fast moving motorized units with air support — would be the way to go. He was right. The first "modern" tank was the 1939 Panzer IV. It could move at nearly 40 km/h and it helped Germany to completely dominate the initial fights. The first successful opponent to the Panzer IV was known as the T-34. The main feature was its sloped armour. It would cause anti-tank shells to break their fuse without exploding.

The German response to the T-34 was the Panzer V, known as the Panther. It also featured sloped armour. It had superior speed and better guns. There were never enough of them, luckily. In response to that, we got one of the most successful tanks in WWII: The T-34-85.

This tank was made with the complete opposite approach to German designs. It was simple, had low fuel consumption, it was fast, maneuverable, had low cost of production, and came in large numbers. Another German flaw was that Hitler insisted that tanks get bigger and bigger and bigger. His involvement produced the Panzer VI Tiger. It was supposed to be a medium sized tank, but mans kept making it heavier and heavier. It was very slow and consumed lots of fuel. The one thing it had going for it was its gun. It caused lots of damage. Another problem was that the amount of armor was literally impenetrable by allied tanks. Since the Germans also had superior optics. Essentially, the Tiger could destroy any allied tank 1 km out of allied range. The Tiger did have a weak point in the back, but that was not the way they were beat. The simple reason they failed so utterly was that they had extremely little fuel. This, combined with it's low fuel efficiency, made it obsolete very quickly. The Russians would eventually make a contender for the Tiger: The IS-2. It used 2-stage ammunition, and ultimately also failed, but Russian tanks would prevail due to sheer quantity.

Hitler was obsessed with tanks. He considered himself the expert, and it was him that pushed tanks to get heavier. This led Germany to develop bigger engines.
