A note on Archimedes: He was not an independent inventor (he's' victim of the great men theory.) He was trained at the Mouseion. They also had mechanical computers around this time, in the form of planetariums. Archimedes wrote and built some of these in his time.

One of the more famous works from Islamic scholars is the *book of ingenous devices* by the Banu Musa brothers, which talked about automatons, gas masks, and mechanical jaws. While it was greatly inspired by Archimedes, they had added their own knowledge. The book was so advanced in terms of mechanics that they surpassed Europe soon after.

## The Little we Know (about Eratosthenes)

Eratosthenes was a professor of mathematics in Alexandria, and later became head of the library. He was described as a very mediocre mathematician, but the be things that this mediocre mathematician did was quite impressive. One of the first things he did was measure the circumference of the earth to a great degree of precision.

Eratosthenes set out to find the distance between earth and moon as well as the earth and the sun. He was off, but it's not bad considering we ourselves struggle with those distances.

Yet another achievement of Eratosthenes was calculating the tilt of earth's axis, again to a very high precision that is still accepted to this day. This is what happens when you pay your scientists and scholars.

Eratosthenes also invented chronology as well as the first star catalog.

In one of the preserved Islamic works were the works of Heron of Alexandria, who was a mechanical genius, from which the book of ingenious devices.

What as unique about this work is that it survived almost intact. These books gave us a very good insight into the technology of ancient Greece.

## Heron of Alexandria

Heron of Alexandria was another teacher/inventor from ancient Greece. We don't *really* know when he was born are when he died, but we do know that during the time the Romans took offer Egypt, he was a teacher and inventor, particularly on pneumatics.  He wrote his own textbook on pneumatics to give to his students. He's absolutely famous for being the greatest inventor of ancient history, but even he himself said that his contributions were tiny, and that the greatest inventors of all time were in fact Archimedes and Ctesibius. You've probably never heard of him, and likely never will after this. But Heron mentions him inventing a mechanical clock, but that's it.

Heron had 11 most interesting contraptions. Some of the things he introduced would completely change the world. The technological achievements of Alexandria are unprecedented. They would do things that we would accredit to other much later civilizations, which is absolutely impressive: The first two were programmable robots and self-powered vehicles that could be pre-programmed to do certain tasks. This wouldn't be replicated until the 2020's. With it, Heron proposed the first sort of programming language.

One of the most famous inventions by Heron was the operational steam engine and the first jet powered steam engine. Humans had *fully working steam engines by 50 AD*. Had they attached a belt and a pulley, they would have started the industrial revolution.

Something smaller but arguably more important would be the vacuum pump. They would end up more important than his steam engines, since the industrial revolution engines would be based on these (combustion engines.)

The next thing he invented was vending machines. They were coin operated and fully automatic.

He too invented the fire engine. An engine designed to put out fires.

A cool thing he also invented was the mechanical door (automatic doors.) It was used to scare off farmers who came to Alexandria.

My guy also tried to make a sort of on/off switch. For it, he invented the first light sensors. Prof does not understand how they did this shit.

Prof's fave invention is the high pressure atomizer (spray.) This would be used for perfumes at first, but to this day it is one of the most important inventions when it came to transportation in the 1920's, becoming the main component behind the carburetor.

The last major invention credited to Heron were wind powered machines. From windmills to organs to eventually piano, wind powered machines changed a lot, like everything else in this list.

He made all these things, *so what?* Well, there was next to no impact. There was no industrial revolution, it would all be mostly forgotten. The main reason behind this would be the government.

The Roman government were not interested in these inventions. This is a perfect example of how technology depends on external factors. In this case, the lack of interest was due to the sheer number of people they had to keep occupied. Other inventions of his were seen more as toys. Many of his inventions were meant to showcase scientific principles rather than sell products, so they never caught on beyond their presentations.
