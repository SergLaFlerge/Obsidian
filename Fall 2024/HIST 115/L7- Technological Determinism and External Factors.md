# Technological Determinism and External Factors

We will look at two main topics: The Chinese connection and the printing press/diffusion of knowledge.

## The Chinese Connection

Ancient Chinese technologies are hard to study as there is very little documentation. We do know the ancient Chinese invented almost everything about 1000 years before the Europeans did. However the Chinese did not use superior technologies in the way Europeans did, but why did it not have the impact it should have?

Most other cultures, upon reaching that level of technological advancement, would set out to try and conquer other places. But not the Chinese. Why?

One of the reasons is the lack of social flexibility. People are prevented from innovating simply by their class. However we know people of lesser social status would still invent things. However, an even bigger reason is an external factor (or two): Government and religion. Government controlled the rate of change/religion/world view. The different world view brought about by religion gave them a different can approach to change.

In the West, we believe that rapid change = progress, which is seen as a good thing. But the Chinese believed that rapid change = imbalance, which is seen as undesirable. This is the foremost reason technology did not make the impact it had. Stirrups are a great example. It appeared very early on, about 60 AD, and although it would take a long time to become common place in China, the impact in Europe was practically instant.

This is a very good argument for technological determinism (in Europe), where the stirrup created a whole new class in Europe.

One of the reasons you became a knight was because you were a Christians and you were fighting for your honor. So now we have a good chunk of the population that is armed with nothing to do. The church had the brilliant idea to send these knights to the ends of the earth so they would never come back. But they won. The first crusade happened in 1095 where Jerusalem was taken. In Jerusalem, the knights found the translated books of Alexandria. Knights may not have been literate but they understood these books had value, so they brought these books to Europe, and that's how the ancient knowledge made its way to Europe. Naturally many of the European translations omitted many things that went against the Christian faith.

From here, we get the Templers, who then go on to make the international bank system. The system was made for people traveling to Jerusalem from Europe, to hold your wealth while you traveled so as to not get robbed.

Knight life was pretty good until about the 1400's, but then came the "elixir of life" from China. What they had really invented was the first explosives. As such, China was the first society to have invented rocketry. They would use them mostly for religious festivals.

About 300 years later, we see the Chinese develop the first black powder guns. Around 1100 AD we see the first pistols and handguns.

### Pigs and the End of the Eastern Roman Empire

The ancient Chinese figured out they could use pigs for warfare, and that was the technology that brought down the Roman empire. Pigs' urine had high ammonia can combine with their droppings to make potassium nitrate. Being able to mass-produce black powder, we start seeing the first mass-produced guns and cannons. From here, the Mongols would capture their guns, and then the Turks, making its way to Europe. The Turks would use these guns to take over Constantinople, ultimately felling the eastern Roman empire. The cannons allowed the Turks to destroy the walls of Constantinople which allowed the Turks to finally conquer the Romans.

By 1450's, medieval castles and knights become obsolete. Instead of castles, the resources required would be put towards more intellectual pursuits. Books became more of a need, but this need would not be able to be met, as books were only copied by monks over a long period of time. Another need was that of religion and the church. It is at this time we start seeing the commercialization of sins/faith. Essentially, you started paying to have your sins absolved. It was genius, but one pope had the even more *brilliant* idea of **pre-paying** for sins you would commit later. This was so successful that the church began to not be able to keep up with demand. The technology to answer the needs of the people would be none other than the printing press. It was from this great need from both the elite as well as the church that the printing press succeeded.

## Diffusion of Knowledge and the Printing Press

We often look at Gutenberg as the first printed book, but that is plain wrong. The printing press was present in China much earlier. We see the movable printing press in China at about 868 AD, and in Korea in 1377 AD. For the printing press to work, you need four things:

1. White paper.
2. Fast drying ink.
3. Reusable types.
4. The press (only the press existed in Europe.)

Going back to China, paper to be invented to China in the first century AD, and Europe would not see it till the eleventh century. However this was still useless. At the time, white paper was made of linen fibers. Before 1347, where the Black Death came into the forefront. The Black Death killed about 50% of the population of Europe. Half the population would become very rich, and for the first time we had an inexpensive way to get linen paper: linen underwear. After the Black Death, people used dead people's underwear to make white paper. Books became a symbol of status for the rich that remained.

Another effect of the Black Death is that a great number of monks/scribes would be wiped out, meaning there would be no way to copy books. That is, until Johannes Gutenberg. Mans was a German goldsmith who also created an oil based ink what was very attractive. In 1450, we get the Gutenberg printing press. The press, along with the plow, is probably the most important invention in human history. The printing press provided free access to knowledge, and removed many gatekeepers, but not all.

The process before the press was as follows:

1. Proposed publication/text.
2. Gatekeepers (Roman Catholic Church.)
3. Impart a small amount to the public.

After the press, your proposed publication/text can simply be printed on a large scale, and one would see a large impact from their work. The gatekeepers may not be removed, but they can no longer control it from sheer volume. It also led to the reformation of the church, leading to Protestantism. Martin Luther's 95 theses from 1517 were able to spread thanks to the press.

Robert Merton's thesis argues that protestant countries where the ones who entered the industrial revolution first. The protestants believed that personal wealth was good, which was in direct opposition to the Christian view.

In about 50 years, we go from 0 to over 11 million books. This leads to the rediscovery of Alexandrian knowledge. Development of the sciences and new technologies lead to new mechanical philosophies, which leads to clocks.
