# Introduction

Technology and history.

The scope of this class is quite broad. It covers about 2.5 million years of history together, and we touch on many fields. We will even go all the way to the present, and even to the future.

## Objectives

1. To trace the impact of technology on society.
2. To reexamine the key concepts, developments, and events in the history of technology. In particular, we will look to step away from the Westernized versions of history.
3. To introduce students to critical thinking and recent historiography.

Textbook is **required**. However, the book does *not* follow lecture material as presented in class. It is meant to supplement the lectures.

Before every exam there will be a review lecture, which will go over contents and style of the exam (essay, multiple choice, et cetera.) These exams will be structured in such a way to test if you have attended all the lectures and took the required notes.

No notes or anything will be posted online.

**Don't miss lectures.**

Don't email mans.
