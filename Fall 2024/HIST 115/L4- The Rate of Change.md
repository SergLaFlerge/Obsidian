Continuing from last class...

From the development of bronze, we get a new relationship with technology where we have created something that did not previously exist in nature.

We start seeing factory-scale production with very high standardization, thanks to the use of molds.

Sumerian society was constantly trading with other societies, some quite far away. One of these would be the *Egyptians*. There is debate as to what technology can be attributed to which society, but the general consensus is that whatever the Egyptians had, the Sumerians had invented about 100 years prior.

Egyptian society had a few advantages over the Sumerians. One of the bigger ones was using technology for social control. At the time, Egypt was the wealthiest society on Earth. They remained largely unconquered for their lifetime, unlike the Sumerians.

They had 2 advantages over other societies at the time:

Firstly, Egypt was surrounded by the desert, but the Nile river was extremely predictable (they would get two harvests per year). Thanks to this, the Egyptians were able to out produce every other society at the time.

The Egyptians would go on to become the longest lived civilization, standing for about 3000 years.

Using priests, and observing the starts, they were able that record patterns that would help predict the movement of the river. Using the divine, social control was established. Naturally, it was these observations that told them, not their gods.

With the invention of the plow and the Nile river, plus social control and their enormous wealth, we see the creation of the Egyptian pyramids.

These pyramids were themselves a form of social control. There is conspiracy surrounding how they were built, but we mostly know how it works. Mainstream media will have believe that they used slaves, but it would make more sense to use paid workers (which goes back to social control.)

Sumerian crops would start giving less and less food as the minerals in the earth diminished, but the Nile brought fresh minerals twice a year.

Since the Nile river would flood twice a year, it would leave farmers with nothing to do with, so to keep people occupied and paid, the Pharaoh would contract these farmers to make projects.

One thing we often neglect to show are mention are all the failures they had. We see many pyramids that are "bent", so what we often see is simply the final product. However, we do see a progression of design.

c. 3100 BC, we see the Mastaba; The first tombs. They weren't built as the exact tomb, but rather underneath it.

c. 2650 BC, we see a new tomb design by Imhotep, where we get these step pyramids that are then rounded into triangular shapes using smaller rocks. The main problem is that it was extremely expensive, which is why we see not many. Only earlier Pharaohs were able to afford it.

But what was the purpose? Two-fold: To preserve the Pharaohs body and his possessions for the journey into the afterlife, as well is keeping people paid and busy (social control.) Was it successful? Absolutely not. The tombs were raided almost immediately after Pharaohs were buried. The second aspect of social control was slightly more successful, but only temporarily, since they sapped Egypt of resources.

There was something the Egyptians could not predict 3000 years ago. The British would grind mummies and turn them into "medicine" to make money. Others would use them as fertilizer? Crazy shit. Even U of A has an Egyptian priest locked up in it's basement.

It's not accessible, we also got it illegally LMAO.

We also got gifted a large bomber, which we lost SMH.

Was Egyptian civilization as technologically advanced as is generally believed? Well, pyramids didn't really change anything. Their society was preoccupied with the afterlife, since immortality after death was a common belief.

Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians all believed that things happened, in heaven and earth, because of the gods. Many societies did and do to this day.

Traveling 2000 years ahead, we find the Greeks, who were particularly unique because they were the first to separate divine from natural phenomena/science/technology. From here we see the first philosophers and scientists. Greek philosophers answered some of the first questions, such as "if the divine did not create us, where did we come from?" From which they reasoned that we evolved. Another question was "if the world is not made of divine material, then what are we made of?" From which the concept of the atom came from. The Greeks would be amongst the first society that would combine science and technology.

# L5-the Invention of Inventing

We will look at

1. Alex, Ptolemy and the Mouseion.
2. Eratosthenes - The little we know.
3. Heron - Magic of technology and invention of "inventing."
4.  Archimedes and the myth of independent inventor.

## 1.

Alexander the great was a Macedonian king that conquered a large area of the world.

332 BC, the Persians took Egypt. Alexander freed Egypt and in return he was made a Pharaoh/living god. Wherever he went, we would spread the Greek culture around the world. This process is called Hellenization - the assimilation of Greek culture, style, language, and society. He named a great number of cities "Alexandria", but we mostly look at the one in Egypt, although it was mostly Greek. Mans got drunk and died young, which caused the collapse of the Alexandrian empire.

### Empire Divided

Ptolemy I was the general of Alexander, and after he died, Ptolemy became Pharaoh. Ptolemy had a big interest in sponsoring inventors, artists, scientists, etc. Having huge resources, he decided to create and support the very first research institute. This institution came to be known as the Mouseion. The institute was divided into faculties, but the big thing was that scholars and scientists were *paid*.

The heart of the research institution was the *great library of Alexandria*. It contained over 1 million texts. Original texts. When it was destroyed, we lost all original works. Thankfully, we had Ptolemy III, who made the wise decision to make copies of certain books and store them into a backup library. Of the 1 million books, about 800 were stored there.

The library was actually destroyed multiple times, but the last one was permanent.

Around 380 AD, Christianity becomes the main religion. The Christians see these books as Pagan and would be against it. This would be the first case we see where societal effects did not affect technology positively.

In 642 AD, the Arabs would destroy some of the books in the backup library, but others would be preserved. The Islamic world would benefit from this, and they would enter an Islamic renaissance while Europe would fall behind. One of the greatest contributions of Islamic scholars is the translation of texts, which would ultimately preserve the works of old.

## 2.

The little we know.

Eratosthenes would be one of the first teaches/directors of the great library. He was the one who calculated circumference of the earth.
