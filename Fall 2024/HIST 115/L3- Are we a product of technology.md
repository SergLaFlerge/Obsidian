# Are we a Product of Technology?

We go through two points:
1. How it all started?
2. Climate change and technology.

Climate change has always been a thing, but a big difference this time around is that it has been mostly man-made. But back to point 1.


## 1.

As we saw in the last lecture, technology is a tool/system we initially used to survive.

### What do we Need to Survive?

Certainly food and water, as well as protection from the elements. We start way back in Africa.

#### Technology-prehistoric period before 32000BC

c. 2.5 million years ago, we start seeing various societies of early humans in an area known as The Great Rift Valley. The GRV looks a lot like Drumheller. These early humans came up with the earliest examples of technology, known as the *flake tools*, or the *Oldowan tools*. Early humans would take hard stones and smash them into softer stones, creating these sharp flakes, often made of quartz, basalt, and obsidian from volcanic activity. In the GRV, humans sought protection from the elements in caves, the oldest of which was Wonderwreck Cave c. 2 million years ago.

Around 1.5 million years ago, we start seeing the development of more advanced tools, which we now call *core tools*, or the *Acheulean tools*. These tools would be used by homo-erectus. The main difference between flake tools and core tools is that core tools are carved with the flakes being discarded, as opposed to the flake being the tool. This also brought some form of standardization to tool making. By then we would start seeing flint being used for tools as opposed to the other rocks. Core tools would completely change our course of history. With the bigger core tools, we were able to obtain more meat from hunting bigger animals.

We now have this surprising side effect from stone tools. In particular, we started developing larger brains. c. 100 000 years ago, we get homo sapiens. This again does not take into account any societal impact. One of the biggest factors not taken into account is the divine. When we first came to be, regardless of everything else, our bigger brained humans started to develop more new technologies.

## Climate Change as an External Factor

The next place to visit is 11 500 years ago, as the ice age ends. Seems good, but within 500 years, it got very hot and dry, forcing humans to move due to lack of food and water.

It is now 11 000 years ago, and humans find paradise: Mesopotamia. This is repeated across the world, but ultimately we have to change the way we lived. We see the domestication of animals and more sedentary lifestyles. In so doing we obtain another major technology: *agriculture*.

We have now transitioned from nomadic to stationary. We see a shift from "eat when you catch it" to "save the best for the next year." Saving the best for the next year, we get better animals and more plants that are more edible. We now started producing more food than *ever before*. In fact we started producing more than what was needed to survive.

This changed **everything**. People would live longer and have more kids, so the population of humans started growing. The surplus of food created

- Division of labor.
- Specialization.
- Political elite.
- First towns.

We start seeing thousands of people living in one area for long periods of time. This is one of the biggest changes due to the surplus of food.

4000 years ago, we create probably the most important tool in early society: **The plow**. The plow changed everything. The world was never the same. It made things possible that could not be done before.

# The Rate of Change

## The Rate of Change

Going back to Africa, we see a 2 million year gap between the use of flake tools to switching to core tools. Fire took about 1 million years. Man-made shelters about 20 000 years, and agriculture took about 2 thousand years, but from the plow to the first civilization was under 100 years. The rate of technological change after the plow became almost instant. We see around this time the first 'civilizations', cities, monumental buildings.

c. 4000 BC. Sumerian civilization is one of the oldest civilizations.

c. 3200 BC. Egyptian civilization is founded.

c. 3100 BC. The Indus valley civilization is known.

We have all these civilizations are being created. It was no longer about survival we were seeking. Technology is no longer exclusively used as a tool to solve problems. We began to exercise dominance *over* nature. From there, we started to exercise dominance over other people, often considered less "technologically advanced."

Another consequence is power/wealth/prestige.

## The First 'Civilizations' and their Legacy/Impact

There are many, but we will focus on the Sumerians, since other cultures basically took from there.

There is a good reason why civilization started where agriculture was first seen. Because of their location, the rivers were not predictable, which led the Sumerians to invent another technology: *Irrigation*. In order for this to be efficient, we need a standardized measurement system. From there they also had to develop a standardized system of communication: *Mathematics*. They would then need people to understand this language and use it to make functional projects, and so came the engineers. Because we had to keep track of when to start and finish, they came up with the concept of time, inventing both the clock and the calendar. With all this, they now had a centralized project management, using large scale labor organizations. Naturally, we would then need resources to pay people to work in these projects. We had people that instead of farming, were exclusively working on these projects. Because of this, we start seeing the first pyramids/ziggurats.

By 4000 BC we have large scale cities with hundreds of thousands of people. The problem is that they now needed people to be able to communicate to their leaders. From here came lawyers. Another problem was record-keeping. With so many people needing to be kept track of, we start seeing clay tablets used for both historical and record keeping purposes. Many of these were essentially receipts, which is one of the reasons we actually know very little about their culture.

c. 3000 BC we start seeing the first alphabet.

Because everyone wanted to trade with these bitches, the wheel is eventually invented as a better transportation system. It did not have the large scale, immediate impact that we may seem to think, as there were no road systems yet, but it catches on eventually.

Due to the growth of trade and wealth, the Sumerians invent the first proper armies. In 3000 BC we start seeing smelting, leading to the development of metal weapons.

We now have tin (230 C) and copper (1084 C) making bronze, giving us a knew relationship with technology, where we have made something that did not previously exist in nature.

1.5 million years ago, we start seeing the development of more advanced tools, which we now call ==core tools, are the Acheulean tools.==
<!--SR:!2024-10-18,24,270-->

The main difference between core tools and flake tools is that, in core tools, ==the flakes are discarded==, as opposed to being the tool.
<!--SR:!2024-10-17,23,250-->

The creation of core tools introduced some form of ==standardization== to tool making.
<!--SR:!2024-10-11,20,250-->

With the bigger core tools, we were able to obtain more meat from ==hunting bigger animals==, giving us larger brains.
<!--SR:!2024-11-10,37,250-->

With our bigger brains, we started to develop more ==new technologies==.
<!--SR:!2024-11-01,35,270-->

With the end of the ice age, the world got very hot and dry, forcing humans to move due to ==lack of food and water==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-09,18,250-->

11 000 years ago, humans find paradise:  ==Mesopotamia==. This is repeated across the world.
<!--SR:!2024-11-01,35,270-->

In Mesopotamia, we see the domestication of animals, as well as another major technology, known as ==agriculture==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-21,27,270-->

As we transition to a more stationary lifestyle, we see, shift from "eat when you catch it" to "==save the best for the next year==."
<!--SR:!2024-10-28,32,270-->

The surplus of food created :: division of labor, specialization, the political elite, and the first towns.
<!--SR:!2024-10-13,10,190-->

The biggest change due to the surplus of food is that we start seeing ==thousand of people== living in one area for long periods of time.
<!--SR:!2024-11-10,37,250-->

4000 years ago, we create the most important tool in early society, ==the plow==.
<!--SR:!2024-11-11,41,290-->

As society developed, we began using technology to exercise ==dominance over nature==, and it was no longer about survival.
<!--SR:!2024-10-09,18,250-->

==power, wealth, and prestige== are other consequences of civilization.
<!--SR:!2024-10-05,11,230-->

Since the rivers in Mesopotamia were not predictable, the Sumerians had to invent ==irrigation==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-11,20,250-->

In order for their irrigation system to be efficient, the  Sumerians needed a standard used measurement system, as well as a standardized way to communicate said measurements, for which they developed ==mathematics==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-17,23,252-->

The Sumerians needed people to understand mathematics and use it to make functional projects, for with the concept of the ==engineer== was created.
<!--SR:!2024-10-09,18,252-->

The concepts of the ==time, clock, and calendar== were invented because the Sumerians had to keep track of when to start and finish projects.
<!--SR:!2024-10-08,7,232-->

The Sumerians would now have people that would work exclusively on construction projects. Because of this we start seeing the first ==pyramids/ziggurats==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-10,6,212-->

Sumerians cities got so large that people started needing specific people to communicate with their leaders, and so ==lawyers== were invented.
<!--SR:!2024-10-09,18,252-->

Despite having a large number of tablets from the Sumerians, we are largely unaware of their culture, as their tablets amount to early ==Walmart receipts==.
<!--SR:!2024-10-06,15,252-->

Since everyone wanted to trade with the Sumerians, the ==wheel== is invented, although it wouldn't catch on right away.
<!--SR:!2024-10-13,19,252-->

The wheel failed to make the immediate impact we think it would have since ==road systems were not yet invented==, making it dangerous to travel by land.
<!--SR:!2024-10-06,15,252-->

The Sumerians invent the first ==proper armies== as a result of their increased trade and wealth.
<!--SR:!2024-10-05,11,232-->

From the creation of the first armies, we start seeing ==smelting==, leading to the development of the first metal weapons.
<!--SR:!2024-10-16,13,252-->

Tin and copper made bronze, giving us a new relationship technology, where we have made something that ==did not previously exist== in nature.
