# East versus West — Quest for Technological and Ideological Supremacy

We focus on three points:

1. Communism — from idealism to horrific reality.
2. Growing up and everyday life behind the Iron Curtain.
3. The "secret of secrets" — technology that shocked the wet.

# Communism

Initially, communism was a great alternative to capitalism. In theory, it would make the ideal society/system, with no poverty. Everyone would be equal. Industries would be only owned by the government/the people.

Unfortunately, communism turned into a technology with sole purpose of social control. We can divide communism into four phases. Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, and post-Stalinism.

Marxism arose as a response to the industrial revolution. The goal was the improvement of the working classes. They envisioned equal share in the fruits of industry. It was a response to social/economic injustice.

Marx thought that it would take off in Britain, but was surprised that it took off in pre-industrial Russia. In comes Lenin, who starts the Leninist movement. Leninism had two major goals: Abolishment of legal government, elimination of the church, and the extermination of the upper classes. Marx meant that last part economically, but Lenin took it literally, by executing the upper classes instead. Now, Lenin might have been violent, but he was no psychopath. Stalin, however, was a brute and a psychopath.

Stalinism believed in the elimination of all political/ideological opportunists. They created centralized planning/collectivization of land and housing. There was gigantic poverty and famine.

Post-Stalinism is what we are left with, along with its derivatives. It depends on location and region (China, North Korea, et cetera.) Communism in Russia post Stalin was actually not terrible.

# Growing up and Everyday Life Behind the Iron Curtain — the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (and the Funny)

## The Bad and the Ugly

In short, the secret police. Whether the UB, NKWD, KGB, or otherwise. There was torture, imprisonment, and murders. Another negative was the occupation and Russification of the satellite countries, particularly Poland. There was lots of destruction of Polish cultures/intellectual elite.

Due to the system of production, there was a shortage of just about everything, especially meat. It was later found out that the meat was being sent to Russia. Centralized planning was also an incredible failure. People were allotted 6 rolls of toilet paper *per year*, and 20 liters of gasoline *per month*. There were no spare parts for anything as a consequence.

At least people learned how to build things, so there was a bit of a positive. Another negative, this time for companies, was that just about everything that was manufactured at a huge loss. As an example, the Fiat 126p cost 100000 Zl but was sold for 70000 Zl. Every sale would cost the company 30% per car. Of course it would collapse. Ironically, there was a huge difference between the poverty of the working classes compared to the wealth of the party members.

## The Good

One thing that communism had was support for the families. Kids growing up during that time would remember these as "wonder years". There was a lot of vacation and family time. There were many activities/facilities for kids and family.

The health care system was very robust, at work, school, and home. Every factory and school would have their own hospital, dentist, and more. And it would all be free. We have a shadow of this system here in Canada. People wouldn't have to work at all when sick, and the state would take care of you.

There was "no crime" (no visible crime anyways.) This was due of course by the large police presence. Of course, the majority of crimes were committed by the police.

There was also no unemployment or homelessness. A side effect was that you could go to work and do nothing. This leads to a lack of perspective and motivation, leading to alcoholism. Got so bad that many instituted a rule of no drinking before 1pm. Did not help much as people simply made their own shit at home.

Higher education such as university was free, but those who were more highly educated were paid less than the uneducated. A PhD would make less than a factory worker. A consequence of this was that people doing PhDs would do it mostly for the passion rather than the money.

Housing was also "free". They believed that "[the] house is a right of every citizen, not a commodity." Naturally, the free homes were ugly apartments, however there were no developers, and so urban planning was a form of art and social improvement. "At no point should pedestrian are child need to cross a road." There would be no need for a car. Communities were formed within these spaces that became self-sufficient. Things were built to last, no planned obsolescence. Everything was 100% reusable packaging. There was no waste. Everything that was grown, was grown naturally. No processed foods.

## The Secret of Secrets — Technology that Shocked the West

In the 70s, Edward Gierek became leader of the Communist party in Poland. He would invest in secret nuclear projects. The main safeguards against people making nukes in their homes are the cost and the impossible to obtain materials. But what if it was possible? In 2020, prof gets access to some documents related to something known as the "Kaliski's affair". From it came the idea of the "neutron bomb". It would be the most powerful nuclear weapon one could produce. A neutron bedroom would be a true fusion bomb. A clean bomb so to speak, as opposed to the H-bombs which were considered "dirty bombs" due to their fission bomb requirements.

The neutron bomb was a wonder weapon. Neutrons penetrate anything in their path, and leave no nuclear fallout. Kaliski would go to the US and reveal this project to the Americans. On the way back, in 1978, Kaliski was killed and his research disappeared.

So why is this of importance today? Well, in 2022, we were finally able to achieve fusion ignition. That is, achieving more energy output than what was used to start the reaction. But we've heard this before, have we not? Kaliski had supposedly already done this in the 70s. This is also posed as "unlimited energy source for world peace." But we know the military implications. We get this dualism of technology and the belief in scientism.
