We cover two important ideas in this lecture:
1. From "puffing devils" to genetics.
2. The goldenage of civil engineers and the eighth Wonder of the World.

First, we talk about women in this era.

## Newton's Legacy

Thanks to Newton, women would not be considered engineers for a very long time, despite even granting them degrees. Alice Perry would be the first woman to receive an engineering degree in Europe, but the first woman to be admitted to the Institution of Civil Engineers in Britain all the way in 1957, whose name was Mary Fergusson.

# From Puffing Devils to Genetics

Women would be allowed to operate newer vehicles such as cars and planes, but where still not allowed to operate others, such as locomotives or even ships.

The first successful high pressure steam train would be made by now forgotten Richard Trevthick. In 1799, we would introduce the high pressure steam engine. It was a completely new design, unlike the modified design of Watt. This was the first proper steam engine, as opposed to what where really is vacuum pumps. This engine was also unique because it was expandable. Watt's engine would always drop in power from wear and tear, which was not the case for the new engine. This other great advantage is that it was small, light, and *powerful*. Watt's engine provided at most 2hp, but Trevthick's engine produced between 40-60hp. Trevthick would then go on to invent the "puffing devil," which was the first full-size road vehicle that worked.

In 1804, Penydarren locomotive would be invented (10 years before the credited Stephenson). This vehicle would travel along tracks (which existed before trains, called wagonways). He would not obtain enough funding and so the vehicle was dismantled and the engine was used in stationary work. In 1808, Trev would do a show, "catch me who can," where he would race people on horses in his vehicle. While he would not obtain the funding, he attracted the attention of George Stephenson. In 1812, Trev designs a new boiler that solved many problems. The firebox sat directly inside the water tank, and the chimney was separated from the firebox by many small, long, winding tubes that would evenly heat the water tank before exiting through the chimney. This greatly increased efficiency and safety.

Trev, however, died in poverty. He was deserted by his family and friends, was unable to get any money, and drank himself to death. Two people destroyed him: George Stephenson and James Watt.

Stephenson was basically lucky. In 1829, we see the first locomotive trials, known as the Rainhill trials. It was organized by the Liverpool-Manchester railway. The prize was 500 pounds and a contract. It was an international contest where many trains had been submitted. But ultimately only 5 made it to opening day. The first of the 5 to go was the Cycloped, with an estimated 1hp. We know this because... It was in fact horse powered. It dropped out because the floor fell apart.

The second to go was known as perseverance (which is definitely ironic.) it would be damaged and would drop out.

The third was Sans Pareil, who suffered cylinder damage.

The fourth was Novelty. It was the best, most powerful, and could go as fast as 45 km/h.

The only engine left was Stephenson's Rocket. He was wrongly credited as the inventor, and his design was not even that great.

The second man to destroy Trev was none other than James Watt.

Watt to go to factories and places using Trevithick's engine, and using his fame, would convince the factory owners that Trev's engine was dangerous, and to stick to the one and only Watt engine. Watt went so far as to try to make special laws against high pressure engines, making them illegal altogether.

## Railroads - Social and Biological Change

The introduction of the railroads give people a much cheaper way to travel long distances. This was an important shift, as it brought many classes of people to travel at the same speed. The railway also brought about some genetic changes as well, as poor people would be able to marry outside their genetic pool.
