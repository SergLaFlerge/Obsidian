We cover two important ideas in this lecture:
1. From "puffing devils" to genetics.
2. The goldenage of civil engineers and the eighth Wonder of the World.

First, we talk about women in this era.

## Newton's Legacy

Thanks to Newton, women would not be considered engineers for a very long time, despite even granting them degrees. Alice Perry would be the first woman to receive an engineering degree in Europe, but the first woman to be admitted to the Institution of Civil Engineers in Britain all the way in 1957, whose name was Mary Fergusson.

# From Puffing Devils to Genetics

Women would be allowed to operate newer vehicles such as cars and planes, but where still not allowed to operate others, such as locomotives or even ships.

The first successful high pressure steam train would be made by now forgotten Richard Trevthick. In 1799, we would introduce the high pressure steam engine. It was a completely new design, unlike the modified design of Watt. This was the first proper steam engine, as opposed to what where really is vacuum pumps. This engine was also unique because it was expandable. Watt's engine would always drop in power from wear and tear, which was not the case for the new engine. This other great advantage is that it was small, light, and *powerful*. Watt's engine provided at most 2hp, but Trevthick's engine produced between 40-60hp. Trevthick would then go on to invent the "puffing devil," which was the first full-size road vehicle that worked.

In 1804, Penydarren locomotive would be invented (10 years before the credited Stephenson). This vehicle would travel along tracks (which existed before trains, called wagonways). He would not obtain enough funding and so the vehicle was dismantled and the engine was used in stationary work. In 1808, Trev would do a show, "catch me who can," where he would race people on horses in his vehicle. While he would not obtain the funding, he attracted the attention of George Stephenson. In 1812, Trev designs a new boiler that solved many problems. The firebox sat directly inside the water tank, and the chimney was separated from the firebox by many small, long, winding tubes that would evenly heat the water tank before exiting through the chimney. This greatly increased efficiency and safety.

Trev, however, died in poverty. He was deserted by his family and friends, was unable to get any money, and drank himself to death. Two people destroyed him: George Stephenson and James Watt.

Stephenson was basically lucky. In 1829, we see the first locomotive trials, known as the Rainhill trials. It was organized by the Liverpool-Manchester railway. The prize was 500 pounds and a contract. It was an international contest where many trains had been submitted. But ultimately only 5 made it to opening day. The first of the 5 to go was the Cycloped, with an estimated 1hp. We know this because... It was in fact horse powered. It dropped out because the floor fell apart.

The second to go was known as perseverance (which is definitely ironic.) it would be damaged and would drop out.

The third was Sans Pareil, who suffered cylinder damage.

The fourth was Novelty. It was the best, most powerful, and could go as fast as 45 km/h.

The only engine left was Stephenson's Rocket. He was wrongly credited as the inventor, and his design was not even that great.

The second man to destroy Trev was none other than James Watt.

```

Watt to go to factories and places using Trevithick's engine, and using his fame, would convince the factory owners that Trev's engine was dangerous, and to stick to the one and only Watt engine. Watt went so far as to try to make special laws against high pressure engines, making them illegal altogether.

## Railroads - Social and Biological Change

The introduction of the railroads give people a much cheaper way to travel long distances. This was an important shift, as it brought many classes of people to travel at the same speed. The railway also brought about some genetic changes as well, as poor people would be able to marry outside their genetic pool.

# The Golden Age of Civil Engineers and the Eighth Wonder of the World

We start this chapter with Isambard Kingdom Brunel, son of the other Brunel. He is known as the "man who built the modern world." He completed 25 railroads, 130 bridges, the first underwater tunnel, and generally cause a revolution in transportation/globalization.

In 1835, there is a board meeting for the Great Western Railway Company. Their main concern to Brunel was the length of the line. He got up and pretty much said "how bout we extend it??" By the end of this meeting, the board is now invested into a new, untested technology of steam ships. He had the designs ready by next morning. In 1838, his ship sails to New York in only 15 days. In 1843, he would make the "ocean liner" which totally revolutionized ship design, by building it completely out of iron. This was also the first ship to be powered by propeller, rather than the big water wheels on the sides from the past.

Here we see technology being very influenced by external social factors, as support of the public for civil engineers was highly positive. We see here the concept of technological positivism in action.

With all this support and social influence, Brunel is decides to make the monster ship "crystal palace of the sea ." This would go on to become the most expensive project of the industrial revolution. It was meant to carry anywhere between 4000-15000 passengers, first-class only. Had he maybe not made it first-class only, there may have been more demand for it, but there simply were not enough aristocrats to make it viable. For reference, the Titanic held a measly 2200 passengers, and that was made a century later.

The crystal palace was a real building made of iron and glass, and it cost around 79000 pounds. Brunel's project would cost around 1.6 million pounds. His ships were made "unsinkable" using something known as cellular construction, where the hull was made in two parts held together by iron walls that made watertight cells. For the Great Eastern (the monster ship), he also added several watertight compartments on top of the double hull. This was also the first ship with three individual propulsion systems.

By 1857, the hull was finished, but it left the company in financial ruin. They tried to launch the ship, but it went horribly wrong. A bunch of people died, and the ship can ceased. That thing was unlaunchable. Finally, they managed to "launch" it using hydraulic presses, and it took months. In 1859, the Great Eastern finally makes its maiden voyage. However the engine designer welded the emergency valve for the steam to escape. September 15, the pressure rises to the point that it exploded. News reach Brunel and he literally dies from heartbreak. In 1860 they make the first transatlantic voyage in a mere nine days. Very impressive even by modern standards. Half a million people waited by the ocean in New York. However... They couldn't figure out how to make it stop. The ship rammed the port and more people died. Two companies have now been ruined by this ship.

A third company tried to make it a tourist attraction, but people kept getting lost due to the sheer size. In 1861, the Great Eastern encounters a hurricane. It looses both power and steering, and should have capsized, but it was too well designed, so people were just thrown about.

At some point, they notice a 30 m hole underwater, for which they had to invent a completely new method of riveting underwater.

The summary is that every company that obtained her was ruined. And they could not get rid of it, for it could not sink.

Someone tried to make it into the biggest drydock, but they too failed miserably.

Henry Bath and Sons buy the Great Eastern for 16000 pounds. The tried to destroy it using many methods, even inventing the wrecking ball in the process, but it took a whole **two** years to dismantle. This was the only company to make any amount of profit.

Regardless, the Great Eastern changes peoples perception of time through the sheer power and speed of travel.

The industrial revolution was the first period in history that was documented by photography.
