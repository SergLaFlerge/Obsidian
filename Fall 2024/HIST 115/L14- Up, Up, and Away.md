# Up, Up, and Away

We focus on two points:

1. The Early Flight.
2. Wright Brothers and Beyond.

## The Early Flight

As usual, nobody "invented" aircraft. It was a work of many inventors/scientists/engineers.

So, who was the first to fly? Yuan Huangtou in AD 550. At least the first to survive. c. AD 1300 we see some military use.

1852 was the first documented successful powered and controlled fight. It was done by Henri Giffard, which traveled around 28 km and carried passengers.

In 1884, Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs make the first battery-powered electric motor controlled flights. It was also the first flying machine to return to the point of departure.

The first airplane flights were probably done by Clement Ader in 1886. It was a ?mono-wing plane that used a 20-hp engine. It was also super light, weighing only about 290 kg total *with* a pilot. It also had an enclosed cockpit and landing gear. It flew for about 50 m, and it is widely regarded as the first powered aircraft flight. Not prof though, he thinks it didn't happen at all.

In 1897, Clement makes the Avion III for the French ministry of war. It got off the ground and promptly crashed. Should we consider it a successful flight? No.

That same year, Croatian David Schwarz suggests using internal combustion engines/gasoline, and a metal construction. It crashed and he died.

Count Ferdinand Adolf August Heinrich Graf von Zeppelin gets his hands on Schwarz's designs. He turns it into the... Zeppelin. Wow.

It was one of the worst technologies ever created. It was the size of the Titanic, but could only carry a handful of passengers. It used hydrogen for lift and silver paint. There was little to no control and one could easily destroy it in the wrong weather. Also, the silver paint was basically rocket fuel. Go figure.

It became obvious that the future of aircraft was in airplanes. In come the Wright brothers, or so the great many theory would tell you. However, there is strong evidence that they based their work on the work of Augustus Herring in 1897 in Ohio. He was largely forgotten.

## The Wright Brothers and Beyond

Wilbur and Orville Wright were also bicycle producers like Herring. They were different in their approach as they were more interested in the idea of *staying in the air* as opposed to simply getting off the ground. In 1901/2, we see the first gliders by the Wright brothers.

The Wrights are credited with pretty much everything surrounding the airplane. But it was almost all stolen or otherwise taken from other designers. The actual inventor of the engine that the brothers used was made by Charles Taylor. It was very poorly built and should not have worked, but it did, and it was light enough to mount on the glider. The "first" powered flight would happen Dec 17 1903, and it would last for about 12 seconds. It could not take off by itself and was basically catapulted into the air. The Wright brothers would "invent" airplanes and... Nothing happened. According to the great many theory, they should have gone on to become rich and successful, but they had only built this to compete in a military contest and win a prize, but nobody cared. There was no interest in the government or the public. They got so fed up with the indifference that they left for France, where they actually became superheroes. It was this success in France that made the Wright brothers famous. In 1909, the US obtains the flier III for the US army. This would be the first war plane.

The Wright brothers would spend the next years facing off against countless lawsuits. By 1914, their designs were already obsolete. The cases were so many that one of the brothers "expired" before finishing. In fact the settlements would go on post-mortem for many years.

The leading manufacturer for (war) planes was Fokker. The first world war would start in 1914 as the flier III would become obsolete, so Fokker would give Germany a major advantage with their superior plane technology.

Fokker was also the first to synchronize front-facing guns with the plane's propellers.

This new technology was also very open to women. Some of the leading manufacturing facilities would in fact design planes for specific women.

### After the War

The airplane emerged as a successful war technology, but it had no commercial appeal yet. Curtis would go on to design the JN-4 Jenny. It was cheaper than a motorcycle and there were no regulations, so people were crashing into lots of buildings. Hilarious then, less hilarious in the early 2000s, hilarious now.

They were, however, very fragile. It was basically made of wood and tarp, which made it easy to work with, and also cheap, but it was not useful for high altitude, high speed flight. In comes WWII, were we see the next evolution of aircraft. Germany comes in with the Bf-109, and the US would later bring in their own P-39 Aircobra. This is a good example of revert engineering. It was made to support a specific cannon they happened to have a big surplus of. Unfortunately, the guns were so big that the engine would not fit in the front. The engine would now be placed behind the pilot. This would cause many deadly complications, to the point there was a song about not getting the P-39. So what did they do? They gave it to the Russians.

Britain would make a great many planes that were all different. One example is the Hawker Hurricane. It was a big plane, and some version could carry up to 12 machine guns. It would eventually be replaced by the spitfire.

The biggest limitations at this point was the propeller. You can only spin the propeller so fast. By 1939, the need for higher speeds resulted
