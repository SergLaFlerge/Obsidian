# Up, Up, and Away

We focus on two points:

1. The Early Flight.
2. Wright Brothers and Beyond.

## The Early Flight

As usual, nobody "invented" aircraft. It was a work of many inventors/scientists/engineers.

So, who was the first to fly? Yuan Huangtou in AD 550. At least the first to survive. c. AD 1300 we see some military use.

1852 was the first documented successful powered and controlled fight. It was done by Henri Giffard, which traveled around 28 km and carried passengers.

In 1884, Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs make the first battery-powered electric motor controlled flights. It was also the first flying machine to return to the point of departure.

The first airplane flights were probably done by Clement Ader in 1886. It was a ?mono-wing plane that used a 20-hp engine. It was also super light, weighing only about 290 kg total *with* a pilot. It also had an enclosed cockpit and landing gear. It flew for about 50 m, and it is widely regarded as the first powered aircraft flight. Not prof though, he thinks it didn't happen at all.

In 1897, Clement makes the Avion III for the French ministry of war. It got off the ground and promptly crashed. Should we consider it a successful flight? No.

That same year, Croatian David Schwarz suggests using internal combustion engines/gasoline, and a metal construction. It crashed and he died.

Count Ferdinand Adolf August Heinrich Graf von Zeppelin gets his hands on Schwarz's designs. He turns it into the... Zeppelin. Wow.

It was one of the worst technologies ever created. It was the size of the Titanic, but could only carry a handful of passengers. It used hydrogen for lift and silver paint. There was little to no control and one could easily destroy it in the wrong weather. Also, the silver paint was basically rocket fuel. Go figure.
