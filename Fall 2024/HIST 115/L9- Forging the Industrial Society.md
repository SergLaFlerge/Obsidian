 We look at three points:
1. "The holy other."
2.  Steam engine.
3. Factory system.

## The Holy Other and the Experimental Approach

By the 1600's, science becomes a social practice in Europe. The upper classes wants to exchange ideas with other upper classes from other countries. The system was fully controlled by men, and the royal society of London would deny women for a very long time. This was thanks to Newton, who absolutely hated women. Kathleen Lonsdale would be the first female scientist admitted to the royal society in 1945. There were other female scientists technically, but they were always attached to their husbands.

### Newton Lore

Isaac Newton has to go home in 1665 due to the plague. Mans locks himself up in his attic and basically invents the theory fluxions (calculus) ((supposedly)). This would be the biggest breakthrough of all time, figuring out some of the first fundamental laws of the universe. He was the last great Alchemist as well, and so he does nothing with regards to calculus. The west would regard him as "the holy other" and hide his Alchemist side. Betty Dobbs would do some real research and find that he was more Alchemist than scientist.

Newton would "discover" the elixir of life, which was actually just mercury, and he would drink it. A main symptom of mercury poisoning is paranoia, which he fell victim to.

In 1679, Robert Hooke approaches Newton several times, finally managing to ask him to publish his work on gravity. He refused until he was forced in 1687, where he published his Principia Mathematica. It wouldn't have a very big impact due to how hard it was to read. However, this book would change British society. Once his work was translated into English, it was realized that the whole world follows the same universal laws. This would incite social change. People in poverty would no longer be poor due to their since, but because of their social standing.

Newton continued his alchemical work in secrecy. In 1690, Robert Hooke would build reflective telescopes in order to solve the problem of not having good enough telescope technology. Newton gets in a fight with Hooke and proclaims that he will never publish again until Hooke was dead.

Hooke dies 13 years later, and so in 1704 he publishes his second and last work. This work is about the behavior of light. In this work, he claims that light is made of matter (hee-hee). The important thing is that this book also describes how to conduct science in English. We consider 1704 the birth of "modern science." This book gave us a standard oozed system for obtaining facts/knowledge
