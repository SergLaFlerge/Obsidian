# Forging the Industrial Society
 
 We look at three points:
1. "The holy other."
2.  Steam engine.
3. Factory system.

## The Holy Other and the Experimental Approach

By the 1600's, science becomes a social practice in Europe. The upper classes wants to exchange ideas with other upper classes from other countries. The system was fully controlled by men, and the royal society of London would deny women for a very long time. This was thanks to Newton, who absolutely hated women. Kathleen Lonsdale would be the first female scientist admitted to the royal society in 1945. There were other female scientists technically, but they were always attached to their husbands.

### Newton Lore

Isaac Newton has to go home in 1665 due to the plague. Mans locks himself up in his attic and basically invents the theory fluxions (calculus) ((supposedly)). This would be the biggest breakthrough of all time, figuring out some of the first fundamental laws of the universe. He was the last great Alchemist as well, and so he does nothing with regards to calculus. The west would regard him as "the holy other" and hide his Alchemist side. Betty Dobbs would do some real research and find that he was more Alchemist than scientist.

Newton would "discover" the elixir of life, which was actually just mercury, and he would drink it. A main symptom of mercury poisoning is paranoia, which he fell victim to.

In 1679, Robert Hooke approaches Newton several times, finally managing to ask him to publish his work on gravity. He refused until he was forced in 1687, where he published his Principia Mathematica. It wouldn't have a very big impact due to how hard it was to read. However, this book would change British society. Once his work was translated into English, it was realized that the whole world follows the same universal laws. This would incite social change. People in poverty would no longer be poor due to their since, but because of their social standing.

Newton continued his alchemical work in secrecy. In 1690, Robert Hooke would build reflective telescopes in order to solve the problem of not having good enough telescope technology. Newton gets in a fight with Hooke and proclaims that he will never publish again until Hooke was dead.

Hooke dies 13 years later, and so in 1704 he publishes his second and last work. This work is about the behavior of light. In this work, he claims that light is made of matter (hee-hee). The important thing is that this book also describes how to conduct science in English. We consider 1704 the birth of "modern science." This book gave us a standardized system for obtaining facts/knowledge.

In the 1700's, science became something of a social practice for the upper classes. The first of these scientific societies (in Europe) would be founded in 1663 in London, known as the royal society. The royal society was privately and completely independent from the king, unlike the academy of sciences from France in 1666.

We start seeing a new class, the "middle class" thanks to capitalism. People develop a common interest: Making money. This middle class starts becoming richer, and this new wealth would be put towards the utility of science/technology. They became wealthier than the aristocrats but were still not considered as such.

These people would start experimenting with electricity, vacuum, and steam. While electricity would not take off right away, the other 2 led to the industrial revolution. From this research, the steam engine was born.

## Steam Engine

As we know, the steam engine was really invented by Heron of Alexandria, but it served as a perfect example supporting the external approach, as the steam engine would fail to take off due to social factors.

It is a common misconception that the steam engine was invented to power factories, but in fact it was made to solve a completely different problem: Ships. Britain had a large empire that it controlled through its large navy. At this point Britain was running out of wood to make their ships as it keeps being used for heating, so it was banned and they would switch to coal instead. But this too would start to fail as they ran out of coal. They would dig coal to the point that they hit water, and so the steam engine was (re)invented for use as a water pump.

We credit this reinvention to Thomas Savery, but really it was invented by Edward Marquise of Worcester in 1698. The was known as the "miner's friend" and it had a maximum operating capacity of 12m, which was actually useless for its intended purpose. The vacuum pump would still be the first patented steam engine regardless of its failure.

Denis Papin would be the first person to present the vacuum pump to the royal society. In 1681-1708 he would make the steam boat and in the 1690's he would make the first piston engine.

Why did Papin fail? In the external approach, we would say that it was due to his connections, while the internal approach would say that to simply lacked the technology at the time. Papin ran away from France for religious reasons, and would need resources to continue his work. Robert Boyle, the head of the royal society with finance him up until 1691, but mans died so he lost his main supporter. Robert Hooke is his next bet, and he would continue with him until 1703 until Hooke died. At this point Newton would become the head of the royal society, which would be terrible for Papin as Newton and Hooke were enemies.

In 1708, he writes a proposal for which he needs 15 pounds from the royal society. The royal society knew not to mess with Newton, so they would need to deny him. Thomas Savery enters the picture and writes a letter stating that Papin's engine would never work. This is the point that the internal approach sticks to, essentially believing Savery's word without trying to understand Papin's design. However it is quite clear that Newton's personal quarries were the real reason Papin's design never made it past the model phase, which is a very external factor.

Papin would become homeless in 1712 and died a year later. He was then (post death) granted a monetary award and recognition for inventing the pressure cooker. LOL.

Thomas Newcomen was finally the first steam (vacuum) engine that would actually be useful for its mining application. This pump was also commercially available.

In 1764, a Newcomen pump breaks at Glasgow university. They call the person responsible to fix it, and it just so happens to be mfing James Watt. At the time, he was a Scottish instrument maker who was rather unsuccessful. He noticed that, by adding an external condenser, he would reduce the loss of heat. He'd never be able to patent it as is, but he would close the top off to further change the design. Matthew Boulton would help pay for Watt's new engine and in 1774 they would open the Soho engine factory. There was a big problem, however: they needed a high degree of standardization that also needed to withstand high temperatures and pressures.

Funnily enough, the answer would lie within Chinese cannons. To avoid the cannon exploding from its use, the solution was to simply bore the actual barrel instead of casting it. John Wilkinson would invent the cannon boring machine in 1774. In order to transform circular motion into linear, up-and-down motion James Pickard "invents" the crank/flywheel in 1781.

## Factory System

Context: Before the factory system, we had something called the "putting out" system, are the contracted work. This wind of work would be done at a worker's home. People were paid by the amount of products they made. This was a family affair, and people would work as needed to be able to live. The system was very family oriented, and it allowed the workers more freedom. This is how things were in at least Britain.

By the 1720's, we start seeing textile machines that become to large to be housed at home. And so we see the first factories pop up. They were places were these machines would be operated. The factory was a new technology of labor organization, where workers were now removed from families/homes with minimal wages. There was no way for the putting out system, as these machines would massively out produce any work from home model. Workers would now have to work maximum hours for extremely little pay, to the point where the rest of the family would be forced to work alongside you just to keep up. There was no way to climb above the poverty line.

An important paradigm of the factory is *water*. All early factories were powered by water wheels, not steam engines. Water wheels were much simpler than engines and required little maintenance. They were however, rather weak and inefficient.

The first person to have a steam powered factory was Richard Arkwright, who in 1781 made the Cromford Mill, powered by the steam engine.

In 1802, Marc Brunel made the Portsmouth Block Mills, which was particularly special because it was the first factory with automated production/assembly line. Brunel became absolutely famous. We went from needing specialized workers to make these products to being able to use unskilled laborers, which in some sense killed skilled labor.

At this point, the biggest cost was not the production of the items, but rather the cost of delivery. The steam engine solved this problem, by allowing factories to be set up inside cities as opposed to being bound by a body of moving water. Workers would move from their towns into the cities, and so was born the modern industrial society.

This population was very poor. The only people benefiting from this system where the factory owners. It was a time were we had a huge growth in both wealth *and* poverty.

The British developed a specific philosophy: Technological positivism - technology has only a one-way, always positive relationship with society (sounds a lot like technological determinism.) Eventually, wages improve, people's quality of life improves, workers start being provided housing and schools, etc. civil engineers would be seen as heroes. Technology was being used to solve problems once again. From all this we also start seeing a transportation revolution, which makes travel more accessible to everybody.
