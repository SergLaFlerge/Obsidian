# Is Technology Good For Us?

It's hard to argue that it is not, at least to a great extent. We have clean water, indoor heating, shelter, access to food, et cetera. We cover three major points:

1. Supporters of technology.
2. Critics of technology.
3. From technology to technopoly.

## Supporters of Technology

One main voice to examine is Samuel Florman. He is directly against critics of technology.

```
Technological progress is the true measure of human development
```

He believed in technological determinism. One of his main arguments, particularly when addressing more modern eras ,is that engineers are independent from external factors. He argued that engineers simply built things and had no responsibility with how they're used. This is very similar to what our favorite Nazi said, "science does not have a moral dimension." This is certainly a dangerous ideological stance. Many people that subscribe to the idea of the *singularity*. The idea of the singularity is that AI/technological systems should/will become autonomous from people. Prof with believes that we have started reaching that point, thanks to chatGPT, particularly GPT 4, 5, and beyond. It is the first technology to achieve a form of singularity, where AI talks to and learns from AI directly.

These people believe that technology should be autopoietic â€” that technology becomes an evolving system that will become self-creating with obsolete external agents. This does not mean to kill or exterminate humans, but to remove them from technological development.

This thought however, started the myth that unlimited technological progress will eliminate humanity.

 Lewis Mumford believed that technology would never rule humans. He saw our biological progression as a consequence from our technological development, leading to the idea of biological determinism.

## Critics of Technology

Let us start with the Luddites. As opposed to popular belief, Luddites were *not* against technology. What they were fighting for was that, with technological change came social change. The group was made from the struggle between two systems:

1. Factory system profits.
2. Domestic system way of life, social/cultural change.

The social changes that came about from the industrial revolution destroyed older, more domestic systems, and that was what the Luddites fought against. Factory owners would end up in charge of government (and so the law system/parliament/army.)

In 1812, there were about 200 Luddites, who the British government would send 14000 troops and massacred them.

The factory owners then made a new law against groups like the Luddite. Destruction of the machine would now be punishable by death. For the *first* time in human history, the machine had received equal rights to that of humans.

Another critic of technology was known as Jacques Ellul. He believed that we are controlled by technology, and that technology should not be used at any point for political/economical ends. This is exactly what we use it for now.

He saw our society as "sleepers" integrated into the system of technology. There is no way for us to step out and see the world outside technology. Much like Plato's allegory of the cave.

Another critic was Neil Postman. He made three main points regarding technology:

1. Technology, no matter what it is, never has a one-way relationship with society. Technology is a trade-off. We gain but also lose something.
2. Technology always transforms societies. It always has an impact.
3. We are obedient to technology. We are "tools of our tools..."


##  From Technology to Technopoly

The transition from technology to technopoly started in the 40s, with the development of technoscience. It was a tool of warfare and money. With it came the rise of scientism. Scientism is, simply put, the total believe in science and scientific authorities. While Postman believed that technopoly came first, prof thinks that scientism came first.
