We focus on two points:

1. Turbojet Revolution.
2.  The quest for speed.

# Turbojet Revolution

Henri Coandă, from Romania requesting was the first person to invent a plane powered by an early form of the jet engine, known as the motor-jet, in 1910. The motor jet was actually used by the Italians, but they didn't do so hot. However, Coandă's impact would be felt soon enough.

There are 4 main types of jet engines:

1. Turbojet.
2. Turbofans.
3. Pulsejet
4. Ramjet

The turbo jet was the winner of them all. It was more modifiable than others, and going faster involved no more than simply making the jet longer. Well, more or less, since things get very hot, the metallurgy was quite complicated

The turbo fan was very quiet and rather efficient, and was directly base off Coandă's design.

The pulsejet was a very simple design. There was pretty much nothing inside the engine. The air would pass through a metal mesh that would "pulse" (hence the name) and it would just compress the air and fuel to get it to ignite. The main drawback is that it needed assisted takeoff. It did have a maximum speed of 600 km/h.

The ramjet was the fastest of the fastest. It's start speed is around 2500 km/h, and there is no known maximum speed. It has *no moving parts*. Like the pulsejet, it needs assisted takeoff, but it has to be assisted up to mach 2, which is pretty insane. However, after getting it there, you can go as fast as you want, metallurgy and strength dependent.

Hans von Ohain would make the modern turbojet in 1953.

The first operational jet plane was the 1939 Heinkel He 178, going as fast as 650 km/h. While it was never used for military purposes, it made a great test bed for jet engines.

Then, came the 1942 Me 262. It was the first true jet fighter. It had two Jumo turbojets that could take it to speeds of over 800 km/h. It would remain about 100 km/h faster than the allied planes.

One may think that the Me 262 would change the course of the war, but Hitler was highly against it, almost discontinuing it. He was finally convinced to put it into production, but it was much too late to do anything.

As advanced as it was, the Metallurgy became as serious problem, as Germany would not be able to obtain the metals needed.

The absolute limit of propeller planes was the Do 335 in 1944. It would fly at speeds of up to 850 km/h. By then, they would start looking into new methods of propulsion. In 1941, we get the Me 163 rocket fighter. It was cool but very deadly. In fact, the plane itself would claim more German lives than the allied forces. It was the fastest plane around, but it was not great for anything else.

Female pilots would be used by Germany as test pilots for early versions of the 163. One of them would be Hanna Reitsch. These test pilots would be the first to experience the problems with high speed flight. The US would try to make supersonic planes, but all their early efforts would disintegrate at Mach 0.9. The problem was not the the power of the planeself, but rather something known as transsonic speeds. Essentially, the front of the aircraft would reach supersonic speeds before the back. The super-and sub-sonic airflows would work together and destroy the airframe.

# The Quest for Speed

In order to solve the problem of high speed flight, allied forces had to go back to German designs. The first thing they had to do was look at the shape of the wing. The answer to making better wings was known as "swept wings". Swept wings solve the problem of increasing drag by increasing the thickness of the wing, by some complicated physics, makes it look like a thin wing ought airflow.

The next thing was making more powerful turbojet engines. This allowed for higher speeds.

The next and arguably the biggest problem was control surfaces. At such high speeds, the control surfaces would not respond. The answer was simple: Make the control surfaces larger. Next was implementing something known as the "coke bottle principle". By reshaping the engines into a coke bottle shape, one reduces drag. The ultimate combination of all these principles come together in the Lockheed SR 71 Blackbird. It has achieved speeds of over 3500 km/h. It was built purely for speed, with zero armaments.

Engineers combined turbojets and ramjets to achieve this. They first use the turbojets to get up to a high enough sped to activate the ramjets, which would then take it to incredible speeds.
