# Morphology

The third layer of the study of linguistics

## Word Formation, Derivation, Compounding

The main focus include word structure, inflection, and morphophonemic processes.

### Word Structure

**Words** are the smallest free form in language. They need not appear in a fixed position. They are comprised of up to three elements:

1. **Morpheme:** The smallest unit of meaning/function. These are further separated into two categories.
2. **Free morphemes:** Can stand alone as words, while
3. **Bound Morphemes:** must be attached to another morpheme.

For example, the word "cats" $\to$ /kæts/ is composed of one free morpheme (cat) and one bound morpheme (-s).
<br>

<br>

here, it is clear that (se-), (ne-), and (ɂe-) are the bound morphemes, representing the possessor, while (-fí), (-bé), and (dzé) are the free morphemes.

Words can be analyzed by their inner structure based on their comination of free and bound morphemes. If morphemes are the building blocks of words, then their anatomy is comprised of

1. **Root:** This is the free morpheme, which can stand alone and is generally a major word class.
2. **Affix:** These are the morphemes that attach to the free morpheme.
3. **Base (stem):** Where bound morphemes attach to. It may be just the free morpheme or a combination of free and bound.

In the word "blackened", (black-) is the root, which acts as the base for the first affix (-en). The new word (blacken-) is now the *base* for the second affix (-ed).

Words can be constructed from roots **concatenatively** or **non-concatenatively**. Concatenative morphology is linear, meaning words are built by stacking affixes before or after the root/base. Non-concatenative morphology adds affixes in between segments of the root/base. The word unwritten is concatenative (-writ- is the root, with un- and -en added), while a word like kutib in Arabic is non-concatenative (k-, -t-, -b is the root segment).

There are three affix types:

1. **Prefix:**  Attached to the front of the base.
2. **Suffix:** Attached to the back of the base.
3. **Infix:** Inserted into another morpheme.

From the example above, (un-) is a prefix and (-en) is a suffix. An English example of an infix can be something like "abso-fucking-lutely", where (-fucking-) is inserted in the middle of (absolutely), which acts as the base. (Absolute is the root.)

Just because something looks like an affix does not make it one. The word "submit" is only one morpheme. There is no (-mit) morpheme. Different from, say "submarine", where (-marine) is the root and (sub-) is the prefix.

### Derivation

First, the difference between derivation and inflection. **Derivation** changes the class of a word, or its meaning. For example "teach" (V) $\to$ "teach-er" (N), "drive" (V) $\to$ "drive-er" (N). **Inflection** adds information to the word without changing its class. For example "teacher" (S) $\to$ "teacher-s" (P).

Word classes can be split into five categories:

1. **Noun:** Entities — Places, things, people,  stuff, ideas, etc.
2. **Verb:** Actions, events, relations.
3. **Adjective:** Qualities/characteristics that describe nouns.
4. **Adverb:** Qualities/characteristics that describe verbs.
5. **Adposition:** Temporal, spatial relations.

Derivations can change parts of speech: kill (V) $\to$ killer (N), cringe (V) $\to$ cringe (Adj), space (N) $\to$ spatial (Adj), etc. They can also change the meaning of a word *without* changing the part of speech: king (N) $\to$ kingdom (N), green (Adj) $\to$ green-ish (Adj), identify (V) $\to$ mis-identify (V), etc.

Derivations can be separated into two classes:

1. Class 1 derivations trigger phonemic changes: critic $\to$ criticize has [k] $\to$ [s] on the last "c".
2. Class 2 derivations then *don't* trigger phonemic changes: fear $\to$ fearless has no changes with the added affix.

### Compounding

Compound words can be classified into two categories:

1. **Endocentric compound:** The meaning of the compound comes from the words its made up from.
2. **Exocentric compound:** The meaning of the compound has no relation to the words it is made from.

## Inflection

There are several ways to carry out inflection:

### Affixation

 Inflection marks five things:

1. **Tense:** Part, present, future.
2. **Person:** First, second, third.
3. **Number:** Singular, plural.
4. **Aspect:** Perfect, progressive.
5. **Mood:** Indicative, subjunctive.

English mostly uses affixation for its inflection.

### Internal Change

Self-explanatory. This type of inflection does not use affixation. Instead, the phonological segments are modified:

<br>

### Suppletion

Here, the inflection is carried out by an entirely different word altogether:

![[Pasted image 20250414140904.png]]

### Case Marking

Case marking tells you who is doing what in a sentence. Latin uses affixes to indicate case marking, whereas English uses suppletion. For example "she" (subject) versus "her" (object).

## Morphological Processes

We have already talked about internal change as well as suppletion, but there are several others:

1. **Reduplication:** A word is repeated to symbolize contrast. Example: orang (man, S) $\to$ orang orang (men, P).
2. **Tone:** Different tones mark different kinds of inflection. Example: wó (kill, past) $\to$ wò (kill, future).
3. **Cliticization:** Morphemes that act like words, but can't stand alone. Example: I'm, they're, you're, etc.
4. **Conversion/zero derivation:** No change in the word, simply moved to a new class. Example: ship (N) $\to$ ship (V), water (N) $\to$ water (V). Lots of noun-to-verbs and vice-versa.
5. **Clipping:** Polysyllabic word gets shortened by deletion. Example: hamburger $\to$ burger, application $\to$ app.
6. **Blending:** Two words get mixed into one new word. Example: brother $+$ romance $\to$ bromance.
7. **Backformation:** Removes an "affix" (need not be real) to create a new word. Example: Vapor $\to$ vape, editor $\to$ edit.
8. **Acronyms:** Initial letters of a set of words pronounced as if it were one word. Example: NATO, YOLO, GOAT
9. **Initialisms:** Initial letters are sounded out individually. Example: USA, WTF, DIY.
10. **Onomatopoeia:** Words that represent sensory information. Example: Meow, woof, moo.
11. **Coinage:** Words created from scratch, typically brand names. Example: Kleenex, teflon.

# Syntax and Semantics

Syntax is the meaning of language, while semantics is the form of the meaning; how it is expressed. Both are a combination of phonetics, phonology, and morphology.

The first thing would must talk about is **sign**. A sign is a relation between a **signifier** and a **signified**. The signifier is an overt signal, and the signified is the information that the signal evokes.

## Word Meaning

**Homonymy:** two words that the same form, but mean different, often unrelated things. Same signifier, but different "signifieds". For example, the word "spring" can mean the object or the season. Homonyms can be classified into two categories:

1. **Homophones:** Two words that sound the same but are spelled differently. Example: "to" and "two" $\to$ /tʊ/.
2. **Homographs:** Two words that are spelled the same but sound different. Example: "tear" $\to$ /tir/ or "tear" $\to$ /tεr/.

**Polysemy:** similar to above. One form (signifier) has multiple related meanings ("signifieds"). For example, the word "mole" can be interpreted as the animal, or the impostor that is "borrowed" inside some organization.

**Synonyms:** Words that are different but have similar meanings. Example: Smart versus intelligent.

**Antonyms:** Words that mean opposite things. Example: Good versus bad.

## Predicates and Arguments

**Argument:** Things, people, objects, things that are independent and that participate in predicates. Arguments are usually nouns.

**Predicates:** Qualities, relations, act, states, things that are dependent. Predicates are usually verbs.

The phrase "I love my dog" has two arguments: "I" and "dog", and one predicate: " love". The verb "love" is the signifier and the dog is the signified.

### Valency

In short, **valency** is the number of argument that are required by a predicate. In the example above, the predicate has a valency of 2. Continuing in the same theme, the phrase "the dog sleeps" has "sleep" as its predicate, with a valency of 1, while the phrase "the dog gives me the ball" has "give" as its predicate, with a valency of 3. By number of argument, we have

1. **Intransitive:** Usually represents motion, state of being, or a change of state.
2. **Transitive:** Interaction, motion  $+$ contact, induced change of state.
3. **Ditransitive:** Transfer, interaction that affects a third party.

The phrase "the dog gives me the balance at the park" still only has a valency of 3. The addition of "at the park" can be deleted and the phrase would still be complete. The valency, then, is the *minimal* number of arguments that a predicate needs.

### Grammatical Relations

There are four ways predicates can be related to arguments:

1. **Subject (S):** The argument that does something.
2. **Direct object (DO):** The argument that (S) does something to.
3. **Indirect object (IO):** Argument that is affected by the interaction between (S) and (DO).
4. **Oblique object (X):** Can be considered extra. No immediate relation to the predicate.

"... At the park" was an oblique object.

Intransitive predicates (val $=$ 1) require only an S argument. Transitive predicates (val $=$ 2)  require both an S and DO argument. Ditransitive predicates require S, DO, *and* IO arguments. At no point are X arguments required. 

There are three ways to encode grammatical relations, i.e. to find out which arguments are which:

1. **Word order:** The ordering of the constituents (words/phrases) tells you which argument is which.
2. **Case:** Morphology is used to mark which argument is which.
3. **Verbal agreement:** Morphology is used on the verbs to show which argument is which.

In English, the word order is fixed as S, V, O.

## Semantic Roles

Semantics describe the way an argument participates in an event, regardless of its grammatical relation to the predicate.
<br>

![[Pasted image 20250415120851.png]]
<br>

In the phrase "I ate the cake", "I" is (S), "ate" is (V), and "the cake" is (DO). These are the grammatical relations. In turn, the agent is "I", while the patient is "the cake". We can reword this by saying "the cake was eaten by me", where now (S) is "the cake" and (DO) is "me", but the patient and agent remain the same as before.

If we then add an oblique object and say "I ate the cake with a fork", the above relations remain the same, but we have now added an instrument — namely "the fork "— to the phrase.
<br>

<br>

### Voice Alterations

The (grammatical) **voice** refers to the relationship between a predicate and its arguments. Voice can be altered by changing the placement of the words in a sentence, which gives a slightly different meaning. The grammatical roles change, but the number and thematic roles remain.

There are two categories of voice:

1. **Active voice:** When the subject and agent are the same.
2. **Passive voice:** When the agent is *not* the subject.

The difference in voice highlights either the agent's participation in the predicate (active, the default in English), or the patient's/theme's participation in the predicate (passive, suppresses information about the subject, or implies that information about the agent is unknown).

## Heads, Dependents, Constituents

A **head** is the element that determines the function of the unit. A **dependent**, then, is an element that *depends* on the head. Dependents are anchored to the head. In the example "the dog gives me the ball", the head is "gives", and the dependents are everything else.

We have already talked about predicates and arguments, but we may add a third element: A **modifier**. A modifier adds information to the event, but is not required by the predicate to be a complete sentence. We can add a modifier to the above sentence by saying "the dog gives me the ball at the park", where the modifier is now "at the park". This adds information, but its clearly not required by the predicate.

A **clause** is a unit that consists of a predicate (usually a verb) and one or more arguments. A **phrase** is a group of words that, together, serve a specific function in a clause (it is a piece of clause).
<br>

![[Pasted image 20250415130642.png]]
<br>

Now for some structural terminology:

1. **Noun phrase (NP):** A phrase headed by a noun.
2. **Appositional phrase (AP):** A phrase headed by an apposition.
3. **Adjective phrase (AdjP):** A phrase headed by an adjective.
4. **Adverbial phrase (AdvP):** A phrase headed by an adverb.
5. **Verb phrase (VP):** A phrase headed by a verb. Really, it is a clause.

An argument is now defined as a phrase in a clause that that is *required* by the predicate. The modifier remains as an additive. Extra information but not required by the predicate. Constituents are phrases that could be replaced by a single word in a clause. "The big furry smelly dog" is a constituent, as it can be replaced by "the dog". The head is the element of a unit (either clause or phrase) that determines the function of the unit. The dependents are then modifiers of the head, and are anchored to it.

At the clause level, the sentence "the big furry smelly dog ate the cheese quickly" has one head (ate) and three dependents ("the big furry smelly dog", "the cheese", and "quickly"). At the phrase level, however we have three phrases: "the big furry smelly" (dog), "the" (cheese), and (quickly). The heads are in parenthesis and the dependents are in quotations.
<br>

![[Pasted image 20250415131939.png]]
<br>

To the list of word classes/categories, we now add the **determiner** a determiner is a word that points to a noun, i.e. words like "the", "a", "an", "those", "that", etc.

Noun phrases (NP) are headed by nouns, and they can have as modifiers the following:

- Possessors.
- Nouns.
- Adjectives.
- Determiners.

These modifiers can be classified into two categories:

1. **Simple:** These are modifiers that *precede* the noun they modify, *but follow* the determiner.
2. **Heavy:** These are modifiers that follow the head and consist of more than one word.

Appositional phrases (PP) are phrases that are headed by an apposition. In English, these are usually oblique objects. PPs are modified by

- Other PPs.
- NPs.
- Adj.
- Adv.

Phrases may require other phrases. These are called **complement phrases**. PPs require NPs the same way a predicate requires an argument. These can be nested inside one another, leading to complex phrases made up of PPs inside NPs inside PP and so on.

<br>

To show which element is the head and which element is the dependent, languages use dependent marking. A common way is by possession; That is, identifying the NP by linking it to the identity of another NP. For example "Mary's book" uses the " 's " dependent marking to identify Mary as the dependent, and the book as the head. Mary is known as the *possessor*, and the book is the *posessee*. Possessors are always dependents, and possessees are always the head.

### Subordinate Clauses

Clauses can be dependent on other elements of the sentence. These are known as **subordinate clauses**. Subordinate clauses are part of the main/matrix clause, and can also be nested inside other subordinate clauses. There are three types of subordinate clauses:

1. **Complement clause:** This clause replaces an argument in the main clause.
2. **Adverbial clause:** This clause modifies a verb.
3. **Relative clause:** This clause modifies the head of an NP.

Complement clauses are usually headed by a **complementizer** (a word that indicates that the clause is a complement clause). In English, it is usually the word "that"?

Adverbial clauses are subordinate clauses that modify a verb. In English, adverbial clauses function much like PPs or adverbs, hence the name. Adverbial clauses are headed by specific words, such as "because", "if", or other prepositions. You must use these, otherwise you get two completely separate main clauses.

Relative clauses are embedded inside an NP. They modify the head noun (as a heavy modifier). These are often not complete sentences. Relative clauses can also be headed by a *relative pronoun* ("which", "who/whom", etc.)

And that's everything you need to know, in theory. Time to review and hope for the best.
